# Root Cause Analysis

**Phase**: Deep Investigation  
**Time**: 14:30 - 15:30  
**Status**: 💡 ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED  

## 🎯 INVESTIGATION APPROACH

After cataloging the initial errors, a systematic investigation was conducted to understand the fundamental causes of the schema migration conflicts.

## 🔍 DATABASE ENVIRONMENT DISCOVERY

### Environment Verification Commands
```bash
# Check Supabase status
supabase status
# Result: Docker daemon not running

# Check for local PostgreSQL
ps aux | grep postgres
# Result: No local PostgreSQL processes

# Check environment variables
cat .env
# Result: Remote Supabase URLs configured
```

### Critical Discovery
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://uheksobnyedarrpgxhju.supabase.co"
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="uheksobnyedarrpgxhju"
```

**Conclusion**: Working with **REMOTE PRODUCTION DATABASE**, not local development environment.

## 📊 MIGRATION HISTORY ANALYSIS

### Local vs Remote Migration Comparison
```bash
supabase migration list
```

**Results Revealed**:
- **Local Migrations**: ~80 migration files from July-September 2025
- **Remote Database**: Already had migrations applied up to `20250902170802`
- **Mismatch**: Local files trying to re-apply already-applied migrations

### Migration History Desynchronization

| Migration State | Local Files | Remote Database | Status |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 20250704092800 | ✅ Present | ✅ Applied | 🚨 CONFLICT |
| 20250706101301 | ✅ Present | ✅ Applied | 🚨 CONFLICT |
| 20250707111011 | ✅ Present | ✅ Applied | 🚨 CONFLICT |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 20250902170802 | ✅ Present | ✅ Applied | 🚨 CONFLICT |
| 20250902171515 | ✅ Present | ❌ Not Applied | ✅ READY |

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE #1: MIGRATION HISTORY DESYNC

### The Core Problem
The Supabase CLI migration tracking system was out of sync between local and remote environments:

1. **Remote Database**: Had migrations applied and recorded in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`
2. **Local CLI**: Did not have these migrations marked as "applied" in its tracking
3. **Result**: CLI attempted to re-apply already-applied migrations

### Why This Happened
- **Development Workflow**: Migrations were applied directly to production at various times
- **Local Environment**: Not consistently updated with remote migration state
- **CLI State**: Local Supabase CLI state not synchronized with production

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE #2: SCHEMA OBJECT CONFLICTS

### Duplicate Object Creation
Multiple migrations were creating the same database objects:

#### Policy Conflicts
```sql
-- Migration A
CREATE POLICY "Partners can manage own upload quota" ON partner_upload_quota...

-- Migration B (later)
CREATE POLICY "Partners can manage own upload quota" ON partner_upload_quota...
```

#### Constraint Conflicts
```sql
-- Migration A
ALTER TABLE ga4_daily ADD CONSTRAINT ga4_daily_partner_date_unique...

-- Migration B (later)  
ALTER TABLE ga4_daily ADD CONSTRAINT ga4_daily_partner_date_unique...
```

#### Trigger Conflicts
```sql
-- Migration A
CREATE TRIGGER trg_gmb_profiles_updated_at...

-- Migration B (later)
CREATE TRIGGER trg_gmb_profiles_updated_at...
```

### Why Duplicates Existed
1. **Iterative Development** - Multiple attempts to create same functionality
2. **Incomplete Rollbacks** - Previous migrations not properly cleaned up
3. **Schema Evolution** - Requirements changed, leading to duplicate implementations

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE #3: NON-EXISTENT COLUMN REFERENCES

### The `partner_id` Problem
```sql
DELETE FROM business_profiles 
WHERE partner_id = '232605e0-2c37-4777-8360-6599504ad144'
```

**Issue**: Migration referenced `partner_id` column that didn't exist in current schema.

### Schema Evolution Analysis
1. **Original Schema**: `business_profiles` table had `partner_id` column
2. **Schema Changes**: Table structure evolved, `partner_id` removed or renamed
3. **Migration Lag**: Old migrations still referenced obsolete column structure
4. **Result**: Column reference errors when migrations executed

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE #4: NON-IDEMPOTENT OPERATIONS

### The Idempotency Problem
Many migrations used non-idempotent operations:

```sql
-- NON-IDEMPOTENT (fails if already exists)
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name...
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name...
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name...

-- IDEMPOTENT (safe to re-run)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_name" ON table_name;
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name...
```

### Impact
- **First Execution**: Migrations worked fine
- **Re-execution**: Failed with "already exists" errors
- **Production Risk**: Impossible to safely re-run migrations

## 🎯 IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Immediate Impacts
1. **Development Blocked** - Cannot apply new migrations
2. **Schema Inconsistency** - Unclear what actual production schema contains
3. **Deployment Risk** - Future deployments could fail or corrupt data
4. **Maintenance Difficulty** - Cannot safely modify database structure

### Long-term Risks
1. **Technical Debt** - Accumulated migration conflicts
2. **Production Instability** - Unreliable database operations
3. **Development Velocity** - Slowed feature development
4. **Data Integrity** - Potential for schema corruption

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Critical Realizations
1. **Production Database Operations** - Working directly with live data requires extreme caution
2. **Migration Tracking Complexity** - Supabase CLI migration state management is complex
3. **Schema Evolution Challenges** - Database schema changes create cascading migration issues
4. **Idempotency Importance** - All database operations should be safely re-runnable

### Technical Learnings
1. **Environment Verification** - Always confirm database environment before operations
2. **Migration History Sync** - Keep local and remote migration states synchronized
3. **Conflict Prevention** - Design migrations to be idempotent from the start
4. **Schema Documentation** - Maintain clear documentation of schema evolution

## 🎯 SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS

Based on root cause analysis, the solution must address:

1. **Migration History Repair** - Synchronize local and remote migration tracking
2. **Conflict Resolution** - Fix all duplicate object creation issues
3. **Schema Consolidation** - Create unified, clean schema state
4. **Idempotent Operations** - Ensure all operations are safely re-runnable
5. **Production Safety** - Implement with zero data loss risk
