# Production Deployment Scheduling Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2025-01-14  
**Status**: Production Ready  
**Assignee**: Release Team

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for scheduling, managing, and executing production deployments for the Bedrock Activation Hybrid Routing system. The deployment scheduler ensures proper coordination, approval workflows, and risk mitigation for all production changes.

## Quick Start

### Schedule a New Deployment

```bash
# Schedule deployment for specific time
npx tsx scripts/schedule-production-deployment.ts --schedule "2025-01-15T02:00:00Z"

# List all scheduled deployments
npx tsx scripts/schedule-production-deployment.ts --list

# Approve a deployment
npx tsx scripts/schedule-production-deployment.ts --approve <deployment-id> <your-email>

# Run pre-deployment checks
npx tsx scripts/schedule-production-deployment.ts --check <deployment-id>

# Execute approved deployment
npx tsx scripts/schedule-production-deployment.ts --execute <deployment-id>
```

### Web Interface

Access the deployment scheduler through the admin dashboard:

```typescript
import DeploymentScheduler from "@/components/deployment/DeploymentScheduler";

// Use in admin dashboard
<DeploymentScheduler
  onScheduleDeployment={handleSchedule}
  onApproveDeployment={handleApprove}
  onCancelDeployment={handleCancel}
  onExecuteDeployment={handleExecute}
/>;
```

- **Prevention**: Check calendar before scheduling

#### Approval Delays

- **Problem**: Stakeholders not approving in time
- **Solution**: Send reminder notifications, escalate to management
- **Prevention**: Schedule with adequate approval time

#### Validation Failures

- **Problem**: Pre-deployment checks failing
- **Solution**: Review check details, fix issues, re-run validation
- **Prevention**: Run checks regularly during development

#### Deployment Failures

- **Problem**: Deployment execution fails
- **Solution**: Review logs, initiate rollback if necessary
- **Prevention**: Comprehensive testing in staging environment

### Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Deployment

1. Contact CTO for emergency approval
2. Use expedited approval process
3. Execute with enhanced monitoring
4. Document emergency justification

#### Failed Deployment Recovery

1. Assess failure impact and scope
2. Initiate appropriate rollback level
3. Notify stakeholders immediately
4. Conduct post-incident review

#### Communication Failures

1. Use backup notification channels
2. Manual stakeholder contact
3. Document communication issues
4. Update notification system

## Best Practices

### Scheduling Best Practices

1. **Plan Ahead**: Schedule deployments at least 48 hours in advance
2. **Choose Optimal Windows**: Prefer weekend early morning slots
3. **Avoid Conflicts**: Check for holidays, high-traffic periods, other deployments
4. **Communicate Early**: Notify stakeholders as soon as deployment is scheduled

### Approval Best Practices

1. **Provide Context**: Include detailed deployment description and rationale
2. **Share Documentation**: Link to deployment plan and technical documentation
3. **Set Expectations**: Clearly communicate timeline and requirements
4. **Follow Up**: Send reminders for pending approvals

### Execution Best Practices

1. **Validate Everything**: Run all pre-deployment checks before execution
2. **Monitor Actively**: Watch dashboards throughout deployment
3. **Communicate Progress**: Provide regular updates to stakeholders
4. **Be Ready to Rollback**: Have rollback procedures ready and tested

### Post-deployment Best Practices

1. **Monitor Continuously**: Watch metrics for 72 hours post-deployment
2. **Document Issues**: Record any problems and resolutions
3. **Gather Feedback**: Collect feedback from operations team
4. **Optimize Process**: Improve procedures based on lessons learned

  activeDeployments.forEach((deployment) => {
    // Send metrics to monitoring system
    sendMetric("deployment.status", deployment.status, {
      deployment_id: deployment.id,
      type: deployment.deploymentType,
    });
  });
}, 60000); // Every minute
```

### Alerting Integration

```typescript
// Integration with PagerDuty/Slack alerting
import { AlertManager } from "@/lib/alerting/alert-manager";

const alertManager = new AlertManager();

// Alert on deployment failures
scheduler.on("deployment.failed", (deployment) => {
  alertManager.sendCriticalAlert({
    title: `Production Deployment Failed: ${deployment.id}`,
    description: `Deployment ${deployment.id} failed during execution`,
    severity: "critical",
    runbook: "https://docs.matbakh.app/runbooks/deployment-failure",
  });
