## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure all hybrid routing components are implemented
2. Verify development environment configuration
3. Check AWS credentials and permissions

### Steps Performed
1. **Component Deployment**: Initialize all hybrid routing components
2. **Feature Flag Configuration**: Enable development-appropriate flags
3. **Smoke Testing**: Validate basic functionality of both routing paths
4. **Architecture Validation**: Test routing decisions and fallback mechanisms
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify integration with existing systems
6. **Documentation**: Generate deployment documentation

### Rollback Procedure
If deployment fails:
1. Disable all hybrid routing feature flags
2. Revert to MCP-only routing
3. Check component health and logs
4. Address issues and retry deployment

### Monitoring
- Monitor hybrid routing metrics in development dashboard
- Check health endpoints for both routing paths
- Review audit logs for routing decisions
- Validate performance metrics

### Next Steps
1. Monitor deployment in development environment
2. Run additional integration tests as needed
3. Prepare for staging environment deployment
4. Update deployment procedures based on lessons learned
