  enableComplianceValidation: true,
  enableVulnerabilityScanning: true,
  enableAuditTrailValidation: true,
  scanTimeout: 1800000, // 30 minutes
  reportFormat: "detailed",
  excludePatterns: ["**/node_modules/**"],
  includePatterns: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.js"],
  securityThresholds: {
    critical: 0,
    high: 2,
    medium: 10,
    low: 50,
  },
};

const scanner = new HybridArchitectureSecurityScanner(config);
const result = await scanner.performComprehensiveScan();

console.log(`Security Score: ${result.overallSecurityScore}/100`);
console.log(
  `Vulnerabilities: ${result.scanResults.mcpRouting.vulnerabilities.length}`
);
```
