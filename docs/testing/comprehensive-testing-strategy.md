## Test Categories

### 1. Green Core Tests (Critical)
- **Execution Time:** <5 minutes
- **Frequency:** Every commit/PR
- **Blocking:** Yes (merge blocking)
- **Coverage:** Core system functionality

### 2. Unit Tests (Fast)
- **Execution Time:** <10 minutes
- **Frequency:** Every commit
- **Blocking:** No (but monitored)
- **Coverage:** Individual components

### 3. Integration Tests (Medium)
- **Execution Time:** <20 minutes
- **Frequency:** Daily/PR merge
- **Blocking:** Conditional
- **Coverage:** Component interactions

### 4. E2E Tests (Slow)
- **Execution Time:** <60 minutes
- **Frequency:** Nightly/Release
- **Blocking:** Release blocking
- **Coverage:** Full user workflows

### 5. Security & Compliance Tests (Critical)
- **Execution Time:** <15 minutes
- **Frequency:** Every commit
- **Blocking:** Yes (GDPR compliance)
- **Coverage:** PII, GDPR, Security

## Quality Gates

### Merge Requirements
1. ✅ Green Core Tests pass (100%)
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
3. ✅ Build validation successful
4. ✅ No critical security issues
5. ✅ PII redaction tests pass

### Release Requirements
1. ✅ All merge requirements
2. ✅ Integration tests pass (>95%)
3. ✅ E2E tests pass (>90%)
4. ✅ Performance tests within thresholds
5. ✅ Security scan clean

## Quarantine Management

### Auto-Quarantine Criteria
- Flakiness >10% over 10+ runs
- 3+ failures in 24 hours
- Consistent cross-environment failures

### Restoration Process
1. Investigate root cause
2. Fix underlying issue
3. Validate fix with multiple runs
4. Restore using quarantine manager

## Performance Targets

### Test Execution Times
- **Green Core:** <5 minutes (merge blocking)
- **Unit Tests:** <10 minutes
- **Integration:** <20 minutes
- **Full Suite:** <60 minutes

### Success Rates
- **Green Core:** 99.9% (critical)
- **Unit Tests:** 98% (monitored)
- **Integration:** 95% (acceptable)
- **E2E Tests:** 90% (acceptable)

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Test execution time trends
- Success rate by category
- Quarantine queue length
- Coverage percentage
- Flakiness detection

### Alert Conditions
- Green Core failure (immediate)
- Quarantine queue >5 tests
- Success rate drop >5%
- Execution time increase >50%

## Best Practices

### Test Writing
1. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Keep tests isolated and independent
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Maintenance
1. Regular quarantine review
2. Performance monitoring
3. Coverage analysis
4. Flakiness investigation
5. Documentation updates

### CI/CD Integration
1. Fail fast with Green Core
2. Parallel test execution
3. Smart test selection
4. Comprehensive reporting
5. Automated quarantine management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Flaky Tests:** Use quarantine system
2. **Slow Tests:** Optimize or move to integration
3. **Memory Issues:** Adjust Jest configuration
4. **CI Timeouts:** Review test selection
5. **Coverage Drops:** Investigate missing tests

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run specific test category
npm run test:green-core
npm run test:jest:unit
npm run test:jest:integration

# Debug failing tests
npm run test:debug

# Check quarantine status
npm run test:quarantine:list

# Generate test report
npm run test:quarantine:report
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. AI-powered test generation
2. Visual regression testing
3. Performance regression detection
4. Advanced impact analysis
5. Predictive flakiness detection

### Metrics to Track
1. Developer productivity impact
2. Bug escape rate reduction
3. Time to resolution improvement
4. Test maintenance overhead
5. CI/CD pipeline efficiency
