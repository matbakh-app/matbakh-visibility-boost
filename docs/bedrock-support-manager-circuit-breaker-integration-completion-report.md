  }
);
```

#### 3. Intelligent Routing with Circuit Breaker Integration

```typescript
// Use intelligent router to determine best path

});

// Execute through selected route with circuit breaker protection
const provider =
  routingDecision.selectedRoute === "direct" ? "bedrock" : "google";
return await this.circuitBreaker.execute(provider, operationFn);
```
