## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Cost Tracking Architecture
```typescript
// Real-time cost calculation per operation
const cost = calculateTokenCost(inputTokens, outputTokens, modelType);
await trackOperationCost(userId, operation, cost, tokenMetrics);

// Multi-level threshold monitoring
const thresholds = {
  warning: { amount: 5.0, action: 'alert' },
  critical: { amount: 10.0, action: 'throttle' },
  emergency: { amount: 25.0, action: 'shutdown' }
};
```

### Predictive Analytics
```typescript
// Usage pattern recognition
const patterns = await analyzeUsagePatterns(userId, timeframe);
const projection = await generateCostProjection(patterns, confidenceLevel);

// Optimization recommendations
const recommendations = await generateOptimizationRecommendations(
  usageData, 
  industryBenchmarks
);
```

### Automatic Control System
```typescript
// Intelligent throttling with model switching
if (costExceeded) {
  await executeControlAction({
    type: 'throttle',
    degradationLevel: 'moderate', // Sonnet → Haiku
    reversible: true
  });
}
```
