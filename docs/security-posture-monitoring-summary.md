# Security Posture Monitoring - Quick Reference

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: âœ… PRODUCTION-READY  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

Comprehensive security monitoring for matbakh.app's hybrid AI architecture with real-time threat detection, compliance tracking, and route-specific security status monitoring.

## Key Features

### Overall Security Status

- Aggregated security health across all routing paths
- Status levels: Secure, Warning, Critical
- Real-time assessment with historical tracking

### Route-Specific Monitoring

- Individual security status for MCP and direct Bedrock paths
- Threat level classification (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Security scoring (0-100) per route
- Comprehensive vulnerability tracking

### Threat Detection

- Active threat monitoring with real-time tracking
- Threat types: PII exposure, unauthorized access, data breach, compliance violation
- Severity classification with mitigation tracking
- Route attribution for affected paths

### Compliance Metrics

- GDPR compliance validation
- EU data residency tracking
- Audit trail completeness verification
- Violation monitoring and reporting

### Security Recommendations

- Automated improvement suggestions
- Prioritized actions by impact
- Actionable guidance with clear steps
- Continuous optimization

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { SecurityPostureMonitor } from "@/lib/ai-orchestrator/security-posture-monitor";

const monitor = new SecurityPostureMonitor();
const status = await monitor.assessSecurityPosture();

console.log(`Status: ${status.overallStatus}`);
console.log(`Active Threats: ${status.activeThreats.length}`);
console.log(`GDPR Compliant: ${status.complianceMetrics.gdprCompliant}`);
```

## Core Interfaces

### SecurityPostureStatus

```typescript
interface SecurityPostureStatus {
  overallStatus: "secure" | "warning" | "critical";
  lastAssessment: Date;
  routeStatus: {
    mcp: RouteSecurityStatus;
    directBedrock: RouteSecurityStatus;
  };
  activeThreats: SecurityThreat[];
  mitigatedThreats: SecurityThreat[];
  complianceMetrics: ComplianceMetrics;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

### RouteSecurityStatus

```typescript
interface RouteSecurityStatus {
  isSecure: boolean;
  threatLevel: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
  lastSecurityCheck: Date;
  vulnerabilities: string[];
  securityScore: number; // 0-100
}
```

## Integration Points

- **Circuit Breaker**: Security monitoring during fault tolerance events
- **Compliance Systems**: GDPR and data residency validation
- **Threat Detection**: Active guardrails and PII detection
- **Monitoring Systems**: Real-time metrics and dashboards

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Critical Alerts

- Overall status critical
- High/critical severity threats
- GDPR/data residency violations
- Multiple route failures

### Warning Alerts

- Overall status warning
- Medium severity threats
- Security score drops >20 points
- Single route failures

### Info Alerts

- Threats mitigated
- Compliance restored
- Security improvements
- New recommendations

## Testing

```bash
# Run security posture tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="security-posture-monitor"

# Comprehensive security tests
npm run test:security-monitoring

# Compliance validation
npm run test:compliance-integration
```
