### 🔧 Critical Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Robust RDS Replication Lag Detection
- **Problem**: Tests failing due to 0ms replication lag returns
- **Solution**: Implemented three-metric CloudWatch query strategy
- **Result**: Proper 30000ms/120000ms lag detection, 45000ms average

#### 2. Injected Client Usage
- **Problem**: Tests creating new CloudWatch clients bypassing mocks
- **Solution**: Guaranteed use of injected mock clients
- **Result**: Consistent test behavior and reliable mocking

#### 3. Seconds to Milliseconds Conversion
- **Problem**: CloudWatch returns seconds, tests expect milliseconds
- **Solution**: Proper `Math.round(seconds * 1000)` conversion
- **Result**: Accurate replication lag reporting
