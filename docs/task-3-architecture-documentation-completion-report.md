- **Subgraph grouping** by component type
- **Interactive legends** explaining color scheme and symbols

### Diagram Variants
1. **Full Diagram** - Complete architecture overview
   - Shows up to 100 most important components
   - Includes all component types and relationships
   - Best for comprehensive system understanding

2. **Critical Diagram** - High-risk focus
   - Shows up to 30 highest-risk components
   - Prioritizes components needing immediate attention
   - Best for urgent cleanup planning

3. **Legacy Diagram** - Migration focus
   - Shows up to 50 legacy components
   - Highlights Supabase/Lovable components
   - Best for migration planning

## 🔍 Key Insights from Analysis

### Architecture Health Assessment
- **Legacy Footprint:** 16% of components are legacy (manageable)
- **Cleanup Opportunity:** 62% of components are cleanup candidates
- **Test Coverage Crisis:** Only 3.89% test coverage (critical issue)
- **Dependency Complexity:** 2,357 connections with 2 circular dependencies

### Priority Recommendations
1. **Immediate:** Address 2 circular dependencies
2. **Short-term:** Implement testing for high-risk components
3. **Medium-term:** Migrate 72 legacy components to Kiro alternatives
4. **Long-term:** Classify 350 unknown components

### Risk Hotspots Identified
- Components with no test coverage and high usage
- Legacy Supabase components with many dependencies
- Components without Kiro alternatives
- Circular dependency chains
