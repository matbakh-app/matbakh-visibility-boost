## Rollback Strategy

### Three-Level Approach

The rollback strategy implements a graduated response system with increasing scope and impact:

#### Level 1: Feature Flag Rollback

- **Target Time**: < 2 minutes
- **Scope**: Disable hybrid routing features without code changes
- **Impact**: Minimal - maintains existing functionality
- **Triggers**: Performance degradation, minor issues

#### Level 2: Traffic Routing Rollback

- **Target Time**: < 5 minutes
- **Scope**: Force all traffic to MCP-only mode
- **Impact**: Moderate - bypasses intelligent routing
- **Triggers**: Routing failures, security issues

#### Level 3: Full System Rollback

- **Target Time**: < 10 minutes
- **Scope**: Complete system rollback to previous version
- **Impact**: High - full application rollback
- **Triggers**: System unavailability, critical failures

### Automatic Triggers

The system includes automatic rollback triggers for critical scenarios:

#### Performance Triggers

- Emergency operation latency > 10 seconds for 5 minutes
- Critical operation latency > 20 seconds for 5 minutes
- System error rate > 10% for 5 minutes
- System availability < 95% for 10 minutes

#### Security Triggers

- GDPR compliance rate < 100% for any period
- Security score < 80/100 for 10 minutes
- PII detection failure rate > 5%
- Audit trail integrity failure

#### Cost Triggers

- Cost overrun > 200% of budget for 1 hour
- Unexpected cost spike > 500% for 15 minutes

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before executing rollback procedures, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables Set**:

   ```bash
   export ADMIN_TOKEN="your-admin-token"
   export API_BASE="https://api.matbakh.app"
   export SLACK_TOKEN="your-slack-token" # Optional
   ```

2. **Required Tools Installed**:

   - `curl` - API communication
   - `jq` - JSON processing
   - `aws` - CloudWatch metrics (optional)

3. **Permissions Verified**:
   - Admin access to feature flags
   - API access to routing configuration
   - CloudWatch metrics access (if available)

### Executing Rollbacks

#### Manual Rollback Execution

```bash
# Level 1 Rollback (Feature Flags)
./scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh 1

# Level 2 Rollback (Traffic Routing)
./scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh 2

# Level 3 Rollback (Full System)
./scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh 3

# Dry Run (Test without changes)
./scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh --dry-run 2
```

#### Validation and Testing

```bash
# Validate rollback procedures in staging
npx tsx scripts/validate-hybrid-routing-rollback.ts staging

# Validate rollback procedures in production (dry-run)
npx tsx scripts/validate-hybrid-routing-rollback.ts production

# Run comprehensive rollback tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="staging-rollback-procedures"
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)

1. **Assess Situation**:

   - Identify severity and impact
   - Determine appropriate rollback level
   - Notify stakeholders if critical

2. **Execute Rollback**:

   ```bash
   # For critical issues, start with Level 2
   ./scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh 2

   # For system-wide failures, use Level 3
   ./scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh 3
   ```

3. **Verify Recovery**:
   - Check system health endpoints
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Confirm user functionality restored

#### Post-Rollback Actions (5-30 minutes)

1. **Stakeholder Communication**:

   - Automatic Slack notifications sent
   - Update status page if applicable
   - Notify management for Level 3 rollbacks

2. **System Validation**:

   - Run comprehensive health checks
   - Verify all services operational
   - Monitor for any residual issues

3. **Documentation**:
   - Incident report automatically generated
   - Log files preserved for analysis
   - Timeline documented for review

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Rollback Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive metrics for rollback operations:

#### Execution Metrics

- Rollback execution time by level
- Success/failure rates
- Recovery time to normal operation
- System availability during rollback

#### Performance Metrics

- Error rates before/after rollback
- Response times during recovery
- Traffic distribution validation
- Service health status

#### Business Metrics

- User impact duration
- Service availability percentage
- Cost impact of rollback
- Time to full recovery

### Alerting Configuration

#### CloudWatch Alarms

- Rollback execution time exceeding targets
- Failed rollback attempts
- System health degradation during rollback
- Incomplete recovery scenarios

#### Notification Channels

- Slack: `#ops-alerts` for all rollbacks
- Email: Operations team for Level 2+
- PagerDuty: On-call engineer for Level 3
- Phone: Emergency hotline for critical issues

## Testing and Validation

### Regular Testing Schedule

#### Monthly Rollback Drills

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Rollback Script Failures

**Issue**: Script execution fails with permission errors
**Solution**:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/hybrid-routing-rollback.sh
export ADMIN_TOKEN="valid-token"
```

**Issue**: API connectivity problems
**Solution**:

```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -s --max-time 10 $API_BASE/health

# Check network connectivity
ping api.matbakh.app
```

#### Feature Flag Issues

**Issue**: Feature flags not updating
**Solution**:

```bash
# Verify admin token permissions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" $API_BASE/admin/feature-flags

# Check feature flag service status
curl $API_BASE/health/feature-flags
```

#### System Recovery Problems

**Issue**: System not recovering after rollback
**Solution**:

1. Check all service health endpoints
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Restart affected services if necessary
4. Escalate to engineering team

### Emergency Contacts
