## Technical Implementation

### Rollback Strategy

The implementation follows a graduated response system:

#### Automatic Triggers

- **Performance Triggers**: Latency > thresholds, error rates > 10%
- **Security Triggers**: GDPR compliance failures, security score drops
- **Cost Triggers**: Budget overruns, unexpected cost spikes

#### Execution Flow

1. **Prerequisites Check**: Validate environment and permissions
2. **Rollback Execution**: Execute appropriate level based on severity
3. **System Validation**: Verify recovery and system health
4. **Post-Rollback**: Notifications, documentation, monitoring

#### Recovery Validation

- System health endpoint checks
- Performance metrics validation
- Error rate monitoring
- User functionality verification

### Integration Points

#### API Integration

- Feature flag management via admin API
- Routing configuration updates
- Health check endpoint monitoring
- System status validation

#### Monitoring Integration

- CloudWatch metrics collection
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Traffic distribution validation

#### Communication Integration

- Slack notifications for stakeholder alerts
- Email notifications for operations team
- PagerDuty integration for critical issues
- Incident documentation generation
