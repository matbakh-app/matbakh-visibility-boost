# Bedrock Activation - Production Deployment Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive production deployment plan for Bedrock Support Mode with Hybrid Routing architecture. The deployment follows a phased approach with strict SLO gates, health checks, and approval workflows.

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Ensure all prerequisites are met before production deployment

**Activities**:

- ✅ Verify staging deployment completion
- ✅ Confirm all test suites passing (Unit, Integration, Performance, Security)
- ✅ Validate security review approval
- ✅ Confirm operations team training completion
- ✅ Verify rollback procedures tested

**Gate Criteria**:

- All staging tests pass with >95% success rate
- Security scan results show zero critical vulnerabilities
- Operations team certification completed
- Rollback procedures validated in staging

### Phase 2: Component Deployment (45 minutes)

**Objective**: Deploy all hybrid routing components to production

**Components**:

1. **BedrockSupportManager** - Core orchestration system
2. **IntelligentRouter** - Routing decision engine
3. **DirectBedrockClient** - Direct AWS Bedrock integration
4. **MCPRouter** - Enhanced MCP integration
5. **HybridHealthMonitor** - Health monitoring system
6. **PerformanceOptimizer** - Performance optimization engine
7. **ComplianceValidator** - Security and compliance validation

**Deployment Strategy**:

- Blue-Green deployment with canary rollout
- Component-by-component deployment with validation
- Automatic rollback on any component failure

### Phase 3: SLO Gate Validation (20 minutes)

**Objective**: Validate all Service Level Objectives before activation

**SLO Gates**:

| Gate           | Threshold                             | Measurement               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| P95 Latency    | ≤ 1.5s (generation), ≤ 300ms (cached) | Real-time monitoring      |
| Error Rate     | ≤ 1.0%                                | 5-minute rolling window   |
| Cost Budget    | ≤ 80% of allocated budget             | Current spend tracking    |
| Cache Hit Rate | ≥ 80% for frequent queries            | Cache performance metrics |

**Validation Process**:

- Automated SLO gate checking
- Real-time metrics collection
- Immediate rollback on any gate failure

### Phase 4: Health Check Execution (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Verify all system components are healthy

**Health Checks**:

- **Direct Bedrock Connection**: AWS Bedrock API connectivity and authentication
- **MCP Router Health**: MCP communication and message processing
- **Intelligent Router Status**: Routing decision logic and fallback mechanisms
- **Circuit Breaker Status**: Fault tolerance and automatic recovery
- **Compliance Validator**: GDPR and security compliance checks
- **Audit Trail System**: Logging and audit trail integrity
- **Monitoring Systems**: CloudWatch, alerting, and dashboard functionality

### Phase 5: Feature Flag Activation (10 minutes)

**Objective**: Gradually activate hybrid routing features

**Feature Flags** (Activation Order):

1. `ENABLE_HYBRID_HEALTH_MONITORING` - Enable health monitoring first
2. `ENABLE_BEDROCK_SUPPORT_MODE` - Activate core support mode
3. `ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING` - Enable intelligent routing decisions
4. `ENABLE_DIRECT_BEDROCK_FALLBACK` - Enable direct Bedrock fallback
5. `ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION` - Activate performance optimizations

**Activation Strategy**:

- Sequential activation with validation between each flag
- 2-minute monitoring period after each activation
- Automatic rollback on any performance degradation

### Phase 6: Production Validation (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Validate hybrid routing functionality in production

**Validation Tests**:

- **Routing Decision Validation**: Test intelligent routing for different operation types
- **Direct Bedrock Operations**: Validate emergency and critical operations
- **MCP Fallback Testing**: Test fallback mechanisms and recovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Validate caching and optimization features
- **Compliance Validation**: Test GDPR and security compliance
- **Audit Trail Verification**: Validate complete audit logging

### Phase 7: Monitoring Activation (15 minutes)

**Objective**: Activate comprehensive monitoring and alerting

**Monitoring Components**:

- **CloudWatch Dashboards**: Hybrid routing metrics and performance
- **Performance Alerts**: P95 latency, error rates, and cost monitoring
- **Security Alerts**: Compliance violations and security incidents
- **Operational Alerts**: Health check failures and system issues

## Approval Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Approvals
