```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database connection successful",
  "data": {
    "version": "PostgreSQL 15.14 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu",
    "tableCount": "13",
    "featureFlags": [
      {"key": "onboarding_guard_live", "value": false},
      {"key": "vc_doi_live", "value": true},
      {"key": "vc_ident_live", "value": true},
      {"key": "vc_bedrock_live", "value": false},
      {"key": "ui_invisible_default", "value": true}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Lambda Functions ✅ ALL OPERATIONAL
- matbakh-create-tables: ✅ RDS Connected
- matbakh-get-presigned-url: ✅ RDS Connected  
- matbakh-s3-upload-processor: ✅ RDS Connected
- matbakh-fix-tables: ✅ RDS Connected
- matbakh-db-test: ✅ RDS Connected
- MatbakhVcStack-VcConfirmFn: ✅ RDS Connected
- MatbakhVcStack-VcStartFn: ✅ RDS Connected

### Production Deployment ✅ ACTIVE
- **URL:** https://matbakh-visibility-boost-pu3gqibtf-rabibskiis-projects.vercel.app
- **Status:** Fully operational with AWS backend
- **Performance:** All features functional

## Risk Assessment - MINIMAL

| Risk Factor | Status | Mitigation |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Data Loss | ✅ None | All data preserved in both systems |
| Service Downtime | ✅ None | AWS running independently |
| Rollback Capability | ✅ Full | Supabase paused, not deleted |
| Cost Impact | ✅ Positive | Immediate savings achieved |
| Security | ✅ Enhanced | AWS VPC + IAM security |

## Rollback Procedures (If Needed)

### Emergency Rollback Plan
1. **Supabase Reactivation:** Unpause project in dashboard
2. **Environment Variables:** Switch DATABASE_URL back to Supabase
3. **Vercel Reconnection:** Reconnect Git integration
4. **Deployment:** Redeploy with Supabase configuration

**Rollback Time:** < 30 minutes
**Data Loss Risk:** Zero (all data preserved)

## Future Cleanup (Optional)

### Phase 3: Permanent Deletion (Recommended after 30+ days)
- **Timeline:** After 30 days of stable AWS operation
- **Supabase:** Permanent project deletion
- **Vercel:** Remove old environment variables
- **Cost Savings:** Additional minor savings

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **Zero Downtime:** Migration completed without service interruption
- ✅ **Data Integrity:** All 13 tables and data preserved
- ✅ **Feature Parity:** All functionality maintained
- ✅ **Performance:** Equal or better response times
- ✅ **Cost Optimization:** Immediate cost reduction
- ✅ **Security:** Enhanced with AWS infrastructure
- ✅ **Scalability:** AWS auto-scaling ready

---
