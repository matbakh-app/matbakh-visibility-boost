## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all hybrid routing tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="(intelligent-router|direct-bedrock-client|mcp-router|hybrid-health-monitor|hybrid-routing-integration)" --no-coverage

# Run specific component tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="intelligent-router" --no-coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="direct-bedrock-client" --no-coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="mcp-router" --no-coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="hybrid-health-monitor" --no-coverage

# Run integration tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern="hybrid-routing-integration" --no-coverage
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Test Failures (Addressed)

1. **SSRFProtectionValidator Mock Issue**: Resolved by proper mock ordering
