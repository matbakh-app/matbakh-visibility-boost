# Task 6.2 Subtask 2: Support Mode Metrics - Completion Summary

**Task**: Bedrock Activation - Task 6.2 Subtask 2  
**Title**: Add support mode specific metrics for both paths  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Duration**: 2 hours

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive support mode specific metrics for the Hybrid Routing Metrics Publisher, enabling detailed tracking and monitoring of all support mode operations across both MCP and direct Bedrock routing paths.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Metrics System

**New Types and Enums**:

- `SupportModeOperationType`: 5 operation types (infrastructure_audit, meta_monitor, implementation_support, kiro_bridge, emergency_operation)
- `SupportModeMetrics`: Complete metrics interface with operation type, route path, latency, success, cost, and timestamp

**New Methods**:

- `recordSupportModeOperation()`: Records individual support mode operations with full metrics
- `getSupportModeMetricsSummary()`: Aggregates and returns comprehensive metrics summary

### 2. Metrics Tracked

**Per Operation**:

- Operation count by type and path
- Operation latency in milliseconds
- Operation success/failure status
- Operation cost in USD

**Aggregated**:

- Total operations count
- Operations breakdown by type
- Operations breakdown by path
- Average latency across all operations
- Overall success rate (percentage)
- Total cost in USD

### 3. CloudWatch Integration

**Metric Names**:

- `SupportModeOperationCount`
- `SupportModeOperationLatency`
- `SupportModeOperationSuccess`
- `SupportModeOperationCost`

**Dimensions**:

- OperationType (5 types)
- RoutePath (direct, mcp, fallback)
- Environment (dev, staging, production)

## Test Coverage

### Test Suite Results

**13/13 Tests Passing** ✅

**New Tests (7)**:

1. ✅ Record support mode operation metrics
2. ✅ Track operations by type
3. ✅ Track operations by path
4. ✅ Calculate average latency
5. ✅ Calculate success rate
6. ✅ Track total cost
7. ✅ Get metrics summary

**Existing Tests (6)**:

1. ✅ Initialize with default configuration
2. ✅ Allow configuration updates
3. ✅ Start and stop publishing
4. ✅ Not start if already publishing
5. ✅ Not start if disabled
6. ✅ Cleanup resources

## Integration Points

### 1. Bedrock Support Manager

Support manager can now record metrics for all operations:

```typescript
await metricsPublisher.recordSupportModeOperation({
  operationType: SupportModeOperationType.INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT,
  routePath: "direct",
  latencyMs: 150,
  success: true,
  costUsd: 0.05,
  timestamp: new Date(),
});
```

### 2. Meta Monitor

Meta monitor operations tracked with detailed metrics:

```typescript
await metricsPublisher.recordSupportModeOperation({
  operationType: SupportModeOperationType.META_MONITOR,
  routePath: "direct",
  latencyMs: 200,
  success: true,
  costUsd: 0.03,
  timestamp: new Date(),
});
```

### 3. Implementation Support

Implementation support operations tracked for optimization:

```typescript
await metricsPublisher.recordSupportModeOperation({
  operationType: SupportModeOperationType.IMPLEMENTATION_SUPPORT,
  routePath: "mcp",
  latencyMs: 300,
  success: true,
  costUsd: 0.04,
  timestamp: new Date(),
});
```
