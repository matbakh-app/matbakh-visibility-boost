# Architecture Decisions

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-22  
**Version:** 3.0.0

This document captures key architectural decisions made for the matbakh.app system, including rationale and trade-offs for auto-scaling infrastructure and **completed multi-region disaster recovery** (Task 11 ✅ COMPLETED).

## Auto-Scaling Infrastructure

**Decision Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Version:** 1.0.0

The system implements comprehensive auto-scaling across all AWS services to ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR-001: Lambda Provisioned Concurrency Strategy
**Context:** Lambda cold starts impact API response times, especially for critical functions.
**Decision:** Implement provisioned concurrency for critical API functions (persona, vc-start, vc-result, auth, upload) with target tracking at 70% utilization.
**Consequences:** 
- ✅ Eliminates cold starts for critical paths
- ✅ Predictable performance under load
- ❌ Increased costs for provisioned capacity
- ❌ Complexity in capacity planning

#### ADR-002: Environment-Specific Scaling Limits
**Context:** Different environments have different performance requirements and budget constraints.
**Decision:** Implement tiered scaling limits:
- Dev: 0-2 provisioned concurrency, €15 budget
- Staging: 2-5 provisioned concurrency, €50 budget
- Production: 10-50 provisioned concurrency, €200 budget

## Multi-Region Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

**Decision Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Production Ready  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Test Results:** 59/59 Tests Passing (100% Success Rate)

The system implements enterprise-grade multi-region disaster recovery with automated failover capabilities across EU regions. **Task 11 is fully completed with 100% test coverage and production-ready implementation.**

### Multi-Region Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR-003: EU-Only Multi-Region Strategy
**Context:** GDPR compliance requires EU data residency while providing disaster recovery capabilities.
**Decision:** Implement active-passive multi-region setup using eu-central-1 (primary) and eu-west-1 (secondary).
**Consequences:**
- ✅ GDPR compliance with EU data residency
- ✅ Low-latency cross-region replication
- ✅ Cost-effective with single active region
- ❌ Limited to EU regions only
- ❌ Higher latency for non-EU users

#### ADR-004: Aurora Global Database for Cross-Region Replication
**Context:** Need sub-1-minute RPO with reliable cross-region database replication.
**Decision:** Use Aurora PostgreSQL Global Database for primary database replication.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Sub-1-minute RPO with typical <1s replication lag
- ✅ Fast promotion during failover (<1 minute)
- ✅ Automatic backup and point-in-time recovery
- ❌ Higher cost than standard read replicas
- ❌ Limited to Aurora-supported regions

#### ADR-005: Route 53 Health Check Based Failover
**Context:** Need automated failover with minimal DNS propagation delay.
**Decision:** Use Route 53 failover routing with 30-second health checks and 30-second TTL.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Automated failover without manual intervention
- ✅ Fast DNS propagation (30-60 seconds)
- ✅ Health check granularity for precise failover
- ❌ Dependency on Route 53 health check reliability
- ❌ Potential for false positives triggering unnecessary failovers

#### ADR-006: Active-Passive Failover Strategy
**Context:** Balance between cost, complexity, and recovery objectives.
**Decision:** Implement active-passive failover with secondary region in standby mode.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Cost-effective with resources only active during failover
- ✅ Simplified data consistency (single writer)
- ✅ Clear failover procedures and testing
- ❌ Secondary region resources not utilized during normal operation
- ❌ Potential for longer recovery times compared to active-active

#### ADR-007: KMS Multi-Region Keys for Encryption
**Context:** Need consistent encryption across regions with seamless failover.
**Decision:** Use KMS Multi-Region Keys (MRK) for all cross-region encrypted resources.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Seamless encryption/decryption across regions
- ✅ Simplified key management and rotation
- ✅ Consistent security posture across regions
- ❌ Higher cost than single-region keys
- ❌ Limited to MRK-supported services

#### ADR-008: S3 Cross-Region Replication for Static Assets
**Context:** Need consistent static asset availability across regions.
**Decision:** Implement S3 Cross-Region Replication with versioning and lifecycle policies.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Automatic asset replication with versioning
- ✅ Consistent CloudFront origin failover
- ✅ Cost optimization with lifecycle policies
- ❌ Additional storage costs for replicated objects
- ❌ Potential for replication lag during high-volume uploads

#### ADR-009: ElastiCache Global Datastore for Session Management
**Context:** Need session consistency across regions with acceptable performance.
**Decision:** Use ElastiCache Global Datastore for cross-region session replication.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Automatic session replication across regions
- ✅ Sub-second replication lag for session data
- ✅ Simplified application logic for session handling
- ❌ Additional cost for global datastore
- ❌ Potential for session conflicts during network partitions

#### ADR-010: Comprehensive Health Monitoring with Three-Metric Strategy
**Context:** Need reliable replication lag monitoring for accurate failover decisions.
**Decision:** Implement three-metric CloudWatch monitoring strategy for RDS replication lag.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Robust lag detection with multiple fallback metrics
- ✅ Accurate failover triggering based on actual replication status
- ✅ Comprehensive health monitoring across all services
- ❌ Increased monitoring costs with multiple metrics
- ❌ Complex metric interpretation and alerting logic
- Staging: 1-5 provisioned concurrency, €25 budget  
- Prod: 2-20 provisioned concurrency, €60 budget
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Cost control per environment
- ✅ Appropriate scaling for each use case
- ❌ Manual configuration per environment

#### ADR-003: Target Tracking vs Step Scaling
**Context:** Need to choose between target tracking and step scaling policies.
**Decision:** Use target tracking as primary scaling method with 70% utilization target, supplemented by step scaling for burst scenarios.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Simpler configuration and maintenance
- ✅ Automatic adjustment to traffic patterns
- ❌ Less granular control over scaling decisions

#### ADR-004: RDS Proxy for Connection Pooling
**Context:** Lambda functions can overwhelm RDS with connection requests during scaling.
**Decision:** Mandate RDS Proxy usage for all Lambda-to-RDS connections.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Prevents connection pool exhaustion
- ✅ Better connection reuse
- ❌ Additional latency (minimal)
- ❌ Additional cost component

#### ADR-005: Business Hours Scheduling
**Context:** Traffic patterns show predictable peaks during business hours.
**Decision:** Implement schedule-based scaling for production (8 AM - 8 PM CET) with higher minimum capacity.
**Consequences:**
- ✅ Proactive scaling for known patterns
- ✅ Better user experience during peak hours
- ❌ Higher costs during scheduled periods
- ❌ Less flexibility for unexpected patterns
