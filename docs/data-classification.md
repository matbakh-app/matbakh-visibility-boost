# Data Classification Framework

## üéØ Purpose

This document defines the data classification framework for the matbakh.app platform, ensuring appropriate security controls and handling procedures are applied based on data sensitivity levels.

## üìä Classification Levels

### üü¢ Public Data

**Definition:** Information that can be freely shared without risk to the organization or individuals.

**Examples:**

- Marketing materials and public website content
- Published API documentation
- Public blog posts and press releases
- General product information

**Security Controls:**

- Standard web security measures
- Basic access logging
- No special encryption requirements

**Retention:** Indefinite (as needed for business purposes)

---

### üü° Internal Data

**Definition:** Information intended for internal use that could cause minor harm if disclosed.

**Examples:**

- Internal documentation and procedures
- Employee directories (non-sensitive)
- General business metrics
- Internal training materials

**Security Controls:**

- Authentication required for access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Standard encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Access logging and monitoring

**Retention:** 3-7 years depending on business need

---

### üü† Confidential Data

**Definition:** Sensitive information that could cause significant harm to the organization or individuals if disclosed.

**Examples:**

- Customer business data and analytics
- Restaurant performance metrics
- Visibility check results
- User behavior analytics

**Security Controls:**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Detailed audit logging
- Data loss prevention (DLP) monitoring
- Need-to-know access principle

**Retention:** 7 years for compliance, then secure deletion

---

### üî¥ Restricted Data

**Definition:** Highly sensitive information that could cause severe harm if disclosed and is subject to regulatory requirements.

**Examples:**

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Payment card information (PCI data)
- Authentication credentials
- Encryption keys and certificates
- Legal documents and contracts
- AI model training data (if any)

**Security Controls:**

## ü§ñ AI Provider Data Classification

### Data Sent to AI Providers

All data sent to AI providers (AWS Bedrock, Google AI, Meta AI) is automatically classified and handled according to strict guidelines:

#### Classification Rules for AI Processing:

1. **PII Detection:** Automatic detection and classification of personal data
2. **Business Sensitivity:** Restaurant-specific data classified as Confidential
3. **Anonymization:** Restricted data must be anonymized before AI processing
4. **No Training Guarantee:** All data sent to AI providers marked as "no training"

#### AI Provider Data Handling:

```typescript
// Data classification before AI processing
interface AIDataClassification {
  originalClassification: "public" | "internal" | "confidential" | "restricted";
  processedClassification: "public" | "internal" | "confidential"; // Never restricted
  piiDetected: boolean;
  anonymizationApplied: boolean;
  noTrainingFlag: boolean; // Always true
  retentionPolicy: "inference_only" | "no_storage";
}
```

### Provider-Specific Classifications:

#### AWS Bedrock

- **Data Classification:** Confidential (maximum allowed)
- **Processing Type:** Inference only, no training
- **Retention:** No data retention by AWS
- **Compliance:** GDPR Article 28 (Data Processing Agreement)

#### Google AI Platform

- **Data Classification:** Confidential (maximum allowed)
- **Processing Type:** Inference only, no model improvement
- **Retention:** No data retention by Google
- **Compliance:** Google Cloud DPA, GDPR compliant

#### Meta AI

- **Data Classification:** Internal (limited use)
- **Processing Type:** API inference only
- **Retention:** No data retention by Meta
- **Compliance:** Meta Developer Terms, limited to inference

## üîí Data Handling Procedures

### Classification Process

1. **Automatic Classification:** System automatically classifies data based on content analysis
2. **Manual Review:** Human review for edge cases and sensitive content
3. **Labeling:** All data tagged with appropriate classification level
4. **Access Control:** Automatic application of security controls based on classification

### Data Lifecycle Management

#### Creation

- Data classified at creation time
- Appropriate security controls applied immediately
- Classification metadata stored with data

#### Processing

- Classification verified before any processing
- AI processing limited by classification level
- Audit trail maintained for all processing activities

#### Storage

- Encryption level determined by classification
- Access controls enforced based on classification
- Retention policies applied automatically

#### Transmission

- Encryption requirements based on classification
- Approved channels only for restricted data
- Audit logging for all data transmission

#### Disposal

- Secure deletion procedures based on classification
- Cryptographic deletion for restricted data
- Compliance with retention requirements
