## Key Features

### üîÑ Automated Rollback Scripts for Each Phase

The system provides automated rollback capabilities for each phase of the cleanup process:

- **Phase 1**: Architecture Discovery & Analysis
- **Phase 2**: Selective Test Validation
- **Phase 3**: Safe Legacy Component Archival
- **Phase 4**: Protection & Governance

Each phase can be rolled back independently without affecting other phases.

### üö® Emergency Stop Mechanisms

Multiple emergency stop mechanisms are available:

1. **Manual Emergency Stop**: Triggered by user command
2. **Automatic Emergency Stop**: Triggered by critical system failures
3. **Health Check Emergency Stop**: Triggered by continuous monitoring
4. **Signal-based Emergency Stop**: Triggered by system signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)

### üì∏ System State Validation Checkpoints

The system creates comprehensive checkpoints at key moments:

- Before each major operation
- After successful completions
- During emergency stops
- On user request

Checkpoints include:

- Complete system configuration backup
- Dependency snapshots
- Validation results
- Rollback metadata

### ‚ö° Rapid Recovery Procedures

Rapid recovery can restore the system to a previous state within minutes:

1. **Automatic Recovery**: Uses the latest available checkpoint
2. **Targeted Recovery**: Restores to a specific checkpoint
3. **Selective Recovery**: Restores only specific components
4. **Dependency Chain Recovery**: Restores components with their dependencies

### üì¶ Archive-Based Recovery

The system maintains a comprehensive archive structure:

```
src/archive/consolidated-legacy-archive-2025-09-18/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive-manifest.json          # Complete component mapping
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rollback.sh                    # Legacy rollback script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manual-archive/                # Previously archived components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ on-hold/                       # High-risk components (soft archive)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ON-HOLD-REVIEW-GUIDE.md    # Human-readable review guide
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ on-hold-analysis-report.json # Detailed analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                       # Original directory structure
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                          # Safe archived components
```

### üîß Component-Level Rollback

Individual components can be restored without full system rollback:

- **Single Component Restoration**: Restore one file at a time
- **Dependency Chain Restoration**: Automatically restore dependent components
- **Batch Restoration**: Restore multiple components by criteria
- **Priority-Based Restoration**: Restore components by importance

### üîó Dependency Chain Restoration

The system automatically identifies and restores dependency chains:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Maps all component dependencies
2. **Chain Resolution**: Identifies complete dependency chains
3. **Circular Dependency Detection**: Handles circular references safely
4. **Incremental Restoration**: Restores dependencies in correct order

### üíì Health Check Integration

Continuous monitoring ensures system health:

- **Real-time Validation**: Continuous system checks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance metrics
- **Automatic Alerting**: Notify on critical issues
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify degradation patterns

  validationChecks: string[]; // Validation checks to run
  emergencyContacts: string[]; // Emergency notification contacts
  maxRollbackTime: number; // Maximum rollback time (minutes)
}
```

### Default Configuration

```typescript
const config: RollbackConfig = {
  archiveDirectory: "src/archive/consolidated-legacy-archive-2025-09-18",
  backupDirectory: "src/archive/rollback-checkpoints",
  validationChecks: ["typescript", "build", "tests", "lint"],
  emergencyContacts: ["admin@matbakh.app"],

- **Dependency Resolution**: Checks all dependencies
- **Import Validation**: Validates all import statements
- **Security Audit**: Scans for vulnerabilities
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitors system performance

### Alerting

Automatic alerts are generated for:

- Critical system failures
- Health check failures
- Emergency stops
- Rollback operations
- Archive operations

### Continuous Monitoring

The system can run in continuous monitoring mode:

```bash
# Start monitoring with 5-minute intervals
npx tsx scripts/system-state-validator.ts monitor 300000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Archive Not Found**

   - Ensure archive directory exists
   - Check archive manifest file
   - Verify permissions

2. **Component Not Found**

   - Check component path spelling
   - Verify component is in archive
   - Use search functionality to locate

3. **Validation Failures**

   - Run individual validation checks
   - Check system dependencies
   - Review error messages

4. **Restoration Failures**

   - Verify dependencies are available
   - Use force flag if necessary

### Emergency Procedures

1. **System Unresponsive**

   ```bash
   # Force emergency stop
   ./scripts/comprehensive-rollback.sh emergency-stop "System unresponsive"
   ```

2. **Critical Validation Failures**

   ```bash
   # Rapid recovery to last known good state
   ./scripts/comprehensive-rollback.sh rapid-recovery
   ```

3. **Archive Corruption**

   ```bash
   # Verify archive integrity
   npx tsx scripts/archive-management-system.ts browse

   # Export backup report
   npx tsx scripts/archive-management-system.ts export --format=json
   ```
