# Bedrock Activation for Infrastructure Stabilization & Implementation Support

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for activating AWS Bedrock as an AI co-agent to support infrastructure validation, detect inconsistencies, help Kiro with pending implementations, and ensure smooth integration of additional components. The system already has comprehensive Bedrock integration infrastructure, and this activation will enable Bedrock to work alongside Kiro as a secondary AI operator for infrastructure stability and implementation support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Bedrock Support Mode Activation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to activate Bedrock in support mode, so that it can assist Kiro with infrastructure validation and implementation support without taking primary control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `ENABLE_BEDROCK_SUPPORT_MODE` feature flag is enabled THEN Bedrock SHALL be available as secondary AI operator
2. WHEN Bedrock support mode is active THEN it SHALL run infrastructure audits using `bedrockAdapter.runInfrastructureCheck()`
3. WHEN Kiro deployments fail THEN Bedrock SHALL be available as fallback support via `bedrockAdapter.probe()`
4. IF Bedrock support mode is disabled THEN all requests SHALL route normally without Bedrock involvement
5. WHEN Bedrock operates in support mode THEN all operations SHALL be logged with prefix "bedrock-activation"

### Requirement 2: Infrastructure Audit and Analysis

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Bedrock to perform infrastructure audits and analysis, so that system inconsistencies and implementation gaps can be automatically detected and reported.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock support mode is active THEN it SHALL perform infrastructure probing and analysis
2. WHEN infrastructure anomalies are detected THEN Bedrock SHALL notify via configured channels (failureDetected, missingImplementations, infraAnomaly)
3. WHEN CI failures occur THEN Bedrock SHALL run health-check mechanisms to identify root causes
4. IF implementation modules are incomplete THEN Bedrock SHALL provide support for backlog items (e.g., Evidently integration)
5. WHEN infrastructure audit completes THEN results SHALL be sent to Kiro via `kiroBridge.receiveBedrockDiagnostics()`

### Requirement 3: Meta-Monitoring and Execution Analysis

**User Story:** As a system reliability engineer, I want Bedrock to monitor Kiro's execution and provide meta-analysis, so that execution issues and performance bottlenecks can be identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock support mode is active THEN it SHALL enable meta-monitoring of Kiro via `bedrockGuardrails.analyzeExecutionStack()`
2. WHEN Kiro execution issues are detected THEN Bedrock SHALL analyze execution patterns and provide diagnostics
3. WHEN failed tests are tagged with `requires-bedrock-support` THEN Bedrock SHALL attempt auto-resolution
4. IF execution anomalies are found THEN Bedrock SHALL generate feedback reports for Kiro on failure clusters
5. WHEN meta-monitoring is complete THEN execution metadata SHALL be extended with "source": "bedrock"

### Requirement 4: Implementation Support and Remediation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Bedrock to provide implementation support and remediation suggestions, so that incomplete modules and failed implementations can be resolved efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incomplete implementation modules are detected THEN Bedrock SHALL provide remediation suggestions via `remediationSuggestions()` method
2. WHEN implementation gaps are identified THEN Bedrock SHALL support backlog resolution for modules like Evidently integration
3. WHEN system inconsistencies are found THEN Bedrock SHALL provide specific remediation steps
4. IF auto-resolvable issues are detected THEN Bedrock SHALL attempt automatic resolution with proper logging
5. WHEN remediation is complete THEN results SHALL be documented and reported to development team

### Requirement 5: Controlled Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Bedrock support mode to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, so that it enhances Kiro's capabilities without disrupting normal operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock support mode is active THEN existing AI orchestrator APIs SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN MCP router is configured THEN it SHALL consider Bedrock in support-fallback scenarios
3. WHEN Bedrock operates in support mode THEN it SHALL not interfere with primary Kiro operations
4. IF Bedrock support is unavailable THEN system SHALL continue normal operations without degradation
5. WHEN Bedrock provides support THEN it SHALL integrate with existing compliance and audit systems

### Requirement 6: Green Core Dashboard Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Bedrock metrics integrated into the Green Core Dashboard, so that support mode operations can be monitored and managed centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock support mode is active THEN metrics SHALL be added to Green Core Dashboard
2. WHEN infrastructure audits are performed THEN results SHALL be visible in dashboard monitoring
3. WHEN support operations are executed THEN status and progress SHALL be tracked in real-time
4. IF support mode issues occur THEN alerts SHALL be displayed prominently in dashboard
5. WHEN dashboard is accessed THEN Bedrock support mode status SHALL be clearly indicated

### Requirement 7: Compliance and Security Maintenance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want Bedrock support mode to maintain all existing compliance requirements, so that security and regulatory standards are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock support mode is active THEN all existing GDPR compliance measures SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN Bedrock processes data THEN it SHALL comply with no-training agreements and DPA requirements
3. WHEN support operations are performed THEN audit trails SHALL capture all activities with compliance metadata
4. IF compliance violations are detected THEN Bedrock support operations SHALL be automatically blocked
5. WHEN compliance checks are performed THEN Bedrock SHALL pass all provider agreement validations (EU-compatible, verified)

### Requirement 8: Controlled Activation and Deactivation

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want controlled activation and deactivation of Bedrock support mode, so that the feature can be safely enabled or disabled without system impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `ENABLE_BEDROCK_SUPPORT_MODE` is set to true THEN Bedrock support SHALL be activated with infrastructure audit initiation
2. WHEN support mode is deactivated THEN fallback routing to Bedrock SHALL be disabled in mcp-router.ts
3. WHEN activation/deactivation occurs THEN the system SHALL continue normal operations without interruption
4. IF support mode encounters issues THEN it SHALL be automatically disabled while preserving core functionality
5. WHEN mode changes are made THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate audit trails and notifications
