## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Hybrid Routing Complexity**: Intelligent routing logic could introduce new failure modes

   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of all routing scenarios and fallback mechanisms
   - **Contingency**: Feature flag allows immediate fallback to MCP-only mode

2. **Performance Impact**: Hybrid routing decisions could impact system performance

   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization in all phases
   - **Contingency**: Circuit breakers and automatic routing optimization

3. **Security Compliance**: Direct Bedrock access must maintain all existing security standards
   - **Mitigation**: Security review at each phase for both routing paths
   - **Contingency**: Automatic compliance validation and blocking for direct operations

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Cost Overruns**: Direct Bedrock usage could exceed budget limits

   - **Mitigation**: Strict cost monitoring and budget controls for both routing paths
   - **Contingency**: Automatic throttling and routing to MCP when budget limits approached

2. **Routing Decision Failures**: Intelligent router could make suboptimal routing decisions
   - **Mitigation**: Routing efficiency monitoring and automatic optimization
   - **Contingency**: Manual override capabilities and routing rule adjustments

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)

1. Disable `ENABLE_BEDROCK_SUPPORT_MODE` feature flag
2. Disable `ENABLE_INTELLIGENT_ROUTING` feature flag (fallback to MCP-only)
3. Verify system returns to normal operation
4. Monitor for any residual issues

### Partial Rollback (< 10 minutes)

1. Execute immediate rollback
2. Disable `ENABLE_DIRECT_BEDROCK_FALLBACK` (keep MCP routing only)
3. Verify MCP routing operational
4. Monitor routing efficiency and performance

### Full Rollback (< 30 minutes)

1. Execute immediate rollback
2. Revert any configuration changes
3. Restart affected services if necessary
4. Validate all systems operational
5. Conduct post-incident review

### Emergency Procedures

- Break-glass access available for immediate intervention
- Circuit breakers automatically isolate failing components
- Monitoring alerts trigger automatic responses
- On-call team notified of any critical issues
- Automatic fallback to MCP-only mode if hybrid routing fails
