## Next Steps

1. **Review Critical Components First**: Start with highest priority components
2. **Create Migration Plans**: For each component, create a detailed migration strategy
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage before any changes
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of changes and decisions
5. **Gradual Approach**: Consider migrating components in small batches
