        question: 'How often are my data really updated?',
        answer: 'With Profile Management Basic, we systematically check your data monthly: opening hours, contact details and seasonal adjustments each 1x per month. Menu updates occur weekly (4x monthly). You receive a detailed monthly report on all changes made.'
      },
      1: {
        question: 'What does "minimum term 6 months" mean?',
        answer: 'The minimum term ensures we can build sustainable success for your business. Google and social media algorithms need time to build trust in your profile. After 6 months, you can cancel monthly.'
      },
      2: {
        question: 'Do I need a Google Business Account for social media management?',
        answer: 'Yes, an active Google Business Account is required for our social media management. Only this way can we establish the SEO connection and ensure that your social media posts also improve your local visibility on Google.'
      },
      3: {
        question: 'How does the employee approval system work?',
        answer: 'Your employees get controlled access through which they can upload photos and texts. All posts are submitted to you for approval - they are only published after your approval. You maintain full control over your brand representation.'
      },
      4: {
        question: 'What is included in the social media channel setup?',
        answer: 'The setup includes professional configuration of your Instagram or Facebook channel: profile optimization, CI-compliant design, initial content strategy, connection to your Google Business Profile and analytics setup for success measurement.'
      },
      5: {
        question: 'Can I upgrade or downgrade packages later?',
        answer: 'Yes, you can upgrade at any time. A downgrade is possible at the end of the minimum term. With the Premium Package you already get all services for 6 months - a later upgrade to individual services is then no longer necessary.'
      },
      6: {
        question: 'How quickly will I see first results?',
        answer: 'First improvements in online visibility are usually seen within 2-4 weeks. Significant increases in inquiries and reservations typically show after 6-8 weeks of continuous optimization.'
      },
      7: {
        question: 'What happens if I cancel?',
        answer: 'Your Google Business Profiles and social media channels naturally remain your property. You receive all access data and handover documentation. Only the ongoing support and optimization by us ends.'
