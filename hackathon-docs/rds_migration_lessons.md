# RDS Migration Lessons - Code with Kiro Hackathon Submission

**Date:** August 30, 2025  
**Project:** Matbakh.app Backend Migration  
**Challenge:** Supabase to AWS RDS PostgreSQL Migration

## 1. Context & Problem

### Original Setup
Our Matbakh.app restaurant management platform was initially built on Supabase, leveraging their managed PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication (`auth.users` table) and Row Level Security. The system included 104+ tables covering visibility checks, business profiles, service packages, and partner management.

### Migration Motivation
We needed to migrate to AWS RDS to achieve:
- **VPC Isolation:** Private database access within our AWS infrastructure
- **Production Stability:** Enterprise-grade PostgreSQL 15.14 with custom security groups
- **Cost Optimization:** Better pricing model for our scale
- **Integration:** Seamless connection with AWS Lambda functions and Cognito

### Critical Timing Issue
The original Supabase tables were accidentally deleted before RDS readiness, creating an urgent migration scenario where we had to rebuild the entire database schema from backup SQL files while ensuring production compatibility.

## 2. Main Technical Challenges Encountered

‚ùå **Tables deleted in Supabase before RDS readiness**  
‚ùå **RDS instance created without proper security group configuration**  
‚ùå **Bastion Host SSH blocked due to missing IP in Security Group**  
‚ùå **psql access failed due to connection timeout**  
‚ùå **IPv6/IPv4 IP address mismatch in security settings**  
‚ùå **Wrong master password confusion across environments**  
‚ùå **Partial schema migration - references to `auth.users` not supported on RDS**  
‚ùå **Public accessibility disabled preventing direct connections**  
‚ùå **AMI compatibility issues for bastion host in eu-central-1**  
‚ùå **RLS policies failing without proper user context**

## 3. How We Solved Each Problem

### üîß Problem: Bastion SSH not accessible from local dev
**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:** Used `curl -s ipv4.icanhazip.com` to get current IP and added rule to `matbakh-bastion-sg` for port 22:
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-062c8ca1721afbe22 \
  --protocol tcp --port 22 \
  --cidr 104.28.62.58/32
```

### üîß Problem: RDS connection timeout despite public access enabled
**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:** Discovered RDS was in mixed subnet group (private + public). Created bastion host in public subnet with private IP access to RDS:
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id sg-061bd49ae447928fb \
  --protocol tcp --port 5432 \
  --cidr 10.0.1.66/32
```

### üîß Problem: Schema migration failing due to `auth.users` references
**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:** Created RDS-compatible schema (`rds-schema-migration.sql`) removing Supabase dependencies:
- Replaced `auth.users` references with standalone `profiles` table
- Modified foreign key constraints to use internal UUIDs
- Adapted RLS policies for custom user context

### üîß Problem: IPv6/IPv4 address mismatch in security groups
**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:** Detected local IP was IPv6 but security groups needed IPv4. Used multiple IP detection methods and added both:
```bash
# IPv4 detection
curl -s ipv4.icanhazip.com
# Added 0.0.0.0/0 temporarily for migration, then restricted
```

### üîß Problem: Wrong AMI ID for eu-central-1 region
**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:** Dynamically queried latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI:
```bash
aws ec2 describe-images --owners amazon \
  --filters "Name=name,Values=amzn2-ami-hvm-*" \
  --query 'Images | sort_by(@, &CreationDate) | [-1].ImageId'
```

### üîß Problem: Password confusion across environments
**üõ†Ô∏è Solution:** Standardized to `Matbakhapp#6x` across all environments and created secure environment variable management.

## 4. Final Deployment Architecture

We deployed a PostgreSQL 15.14 instance in a private VPC, accessible via a Bastion Host. The RDS instance uses a custom Security Group with IP-restricted ingress. All schema migrations are now fully compatible with RDS, and we verified core CRUD functionality with test inserts via the Bastion Host. Feature Flags, Profile Management, and VC Data Tables were migrated successfully.

```
[ Dev Machine ]
      |
   (SSH port 22)
      ‚Üì
[ Bastion Host ]
      |
 (psql over TCP 5432)
      ‚Üì
[ AWS RDS PostgreSQL ]
```

**Final Database Stats:**
- **Tables Created:** 10 core tables
- **Total Columns:** 247 columns across all tables
- **Engine:** PostgreSQL 15.14
- **Security:** RLS enabled, custom policies applied
- **Performance:** Indexes created for all primary access patterns

## 5. Kiro Usage Reflection

### Migration Strategy Development
Kiro guided us through a systematic approach to the migration crisis. When we discovered the Supabase tables were deleted, Kiro immediately structured a recovery plan:
1. **Diagnostic Phase:** Created comprehensive connectivity analysis scripts
2. **Solution Generation:** Provided multiple connection strategies (bastion vs public access)
3. **Implementation:** Generated production-ready migration scripts with error handling

### Generated Scripts & Automation
Kiro created several critical automation scripts that saved hours of manual work:

**`diagnose-rds-connectivity.sh`** - 200+ line comprehensive network analysis
- Automated RDS instance status checking
- Security group rule validation
- Network path analysis with recommendations

**`create-bastion-host.sh`** - Complete bastion host provisioning
- Dynamic AMI selection for region compatibility
- Automatic security group creation and IP management
- User data scripts for PostgreSQL client installation

**`rds-schema-migration.sql`** - RDS-compatible schema adaptation
- Removed all Supabase-specific dependencies
- Preserved business logic while adapting authentication model
- Added performance indexes and RLS policies

### Error Prevention & Recovery
Kiro's iterative approach prevented several critical mistakes:
- **Security Group Management:** Automatically detected IP changes and updated rules
- **Schema Compatibility:** Identified `auth.users` dependency before full migration
- **Connection Validation:** Built-in testing at each migration step

### Time Savings Impact
Without Kiro's support, this emergency migration would have taken 2-3 days of manual troubleshooting. Instead, we completed the full migration in approximately 4 hours, including:
- Network diagnosis and bastion setup: 1 hour
- Schema adaptation and testing: 2 hours  
- Migration execution and validation: 1 hour

**Key Kiro Advantages:**
- **Dynamic Problem Solving:** Adapted solutions based on real-time AWS API responses
- **Production Safety:** All scripts included rollback procedures and validation steps
- **Documentation:** Automatically generated migration reports and cleanup instructions

The migration strategy was shaped iteratively through Kiro prompts, allowing us to pivot from direct connection attempts to bastion host architecture when network constraints were discovered. This flexibility was crucial for meeting our production deadline.
