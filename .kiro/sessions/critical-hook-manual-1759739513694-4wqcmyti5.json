New performance tests (test/green-core-validation/**/*.test.ts) are documented with their purpose and expected outcomes\n4. Any performance optimizations or degradations are properly explained in the documentation\n5. Consider if these changes require updates to performance monitoring dashboards or alerts\n\nIf documentation is missing or incomplete, please update the relevant files before proceeding with the commit. Use the --force-performance-skip flag only in emergency situations where documentation can be updated separately.",
