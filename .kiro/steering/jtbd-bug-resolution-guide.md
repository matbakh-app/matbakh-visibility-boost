# 🛠️ JTBD Bug Resolution Guide – Competing with Luck Approach

> "People don't buy products; they hire them to make progress in their life." – Clayton Christensen

This guide describes how to resolve bugs using the **Jobs-To-Be-Done** (JTBD) approach. This method prevents surface-level fixes and uncovers causal roots by asking: "What job was the user trying to get done when the bug occurred?"

---

## 1. 🧠 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Capture the Bug Context
- Who encountered the bug? (Persona)
- What was the user doing before it happened?
- What job were they trying to complete?
- Where and when did the failure occur?

### Step 2: Frame the Functional "Job"
- Clarify: What was the expected outcome?
- Was this part of a larger workflow?
- What pain or inefficiency did the bug cause?

### Step 3: Identify the Emotional and Social Dimensions
- Frustration, loss of trust, stress?
- Did it affect user perception of reliability or professionalism?

### Step 4: Diagnose the Root Cause
- Use logs, traces, and context replay.
- Ask: Why did this fail? What assumptions did we break?
- Confirm the causal chain with data (not opinion).

### Step 5: Redesign the Experience
- What change would ensure the user can finish the job successfully?
- What friction can be removed?
- Add validations, fallbacks, or UI hints.

## 2. 🧰 Toolkit for Root Cause Discovery

| Tool            | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| CloudWatch Trace | Visualize request chain |
| Structured Logs | Analyze user behavior pre-failure |
| Input Snapshots | Reconstruct the "job context" |
| Persona Map     | Align feature to intended job |
| JTBD Interview Template | Optional for deeper UX issues |

## 3. ✅ Resolution Principles

- **Don't patch symptoms** – solve the systemic problem.
- **Default to user progress**, not internal structures.
- **Log when you *think* it can't fail.**
- **Prioritize fixes that unblock user jobs.**

## 4. 📎 Use Template When Logging Bugs

```yaml
Bug:
  Summary: "Upload failed despite successful file selection"
  JTBD: "User wanted to quickly upload a document to receive AI recommendations"
  Persona: "Gastronomy Partner – Low technical literacy"
  Trigger: "Clicked Upload after filling analysis form"
  Expected: "See upload confirmation + progress bar"
  Actual: "Silent failure + no feedback"
  Root Cause: "Missing consent enforcement in Lambda – request blocked but no feedback returned"
  Fix: "Add server-side consent check + client error handling"
```

## 5. 💡 Quote for Orientation

"The reason a customer hires a product is always tied to the progress they're trying to make in a particular circumstance."

## 6. 🎯 Application to Matbakh Context

### Common JTBD Scenarios in Matbakh:
1. **Restaurant Owner Job**: "Get actionable insights to improve my restaurant's online visibility"
2. **Business Partner Job**: "Efficiently manage multiple client restaurants with minimal effort"
3. **Admin Job**: "Quickly identify and resolve system issues before they affect users"
4. **Developer Job**: "Deploy new features safely without breaking existing functionality"

### Bug Resolution Examples:

#### Example 1: Visibility Check Failure
- **JTBD**: Restaurant owner wants to understand their online presence
- **Bug**: Analysis fails silently after email confirmation
- **Root Cause**: Consent not properly verified before AI analysis
- **JTBD-Focused Fix**: Add clear progress indicators and error messages that guide user to resolution

#### Example 2: Upload System Issue
- **JTBD**: Business partner wants to upload client documents for analysis
- **Bug**: File upload succeeds but analysis never starts
- **Root Cause**: Missing GDPR consent check blocks processing
- **JTBD-Focused Fix**: Implement consent verification UI that clearly explains requirements and next steps

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- Use JTBD analysis in bug reports for Bedrock AI Core issues
- Apply JTBD thinking to Adaptive UI system failures
- Incorporate JTBD principles in monitoring and alerting systems
- Design error messages and recovery flows with user jobs in mind

This approach ensures that every bug fix not only resolves the technical issue but also improves the user's ability to complete their intended job successfully.
