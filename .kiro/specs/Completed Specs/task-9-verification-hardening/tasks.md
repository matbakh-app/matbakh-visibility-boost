## 📋 WORKFLOW GUIDELINES FOR ALL FUTURE TASKS

### 🚨 MANDATORY PROCESS FOR EVERY NEW TASK

**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK:**

1. **🤝 ALWAYS ASK USER FIRST**

   - Before beginning any new task, ALWAYS ask the user if they have additional input, suggestions, or specific approaches they want to follow
   - Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with implementation
   - This applies to EVERY task without exception

2. **☁️ AWS CONSOLE INTEGRATION**

   - Always utilize AWS Console access since AWS credentials are available
   - Check AWS resources, configurations, and services directly
   - Verify deployments and infrastructure changes through AWS Console
   - Use AWS CLI commands when appropriate

3. **✅ GREEN CORE VALIDATION (GCV) INTEGRATION**

   - After completing each task, add all passing tests to the GCV test suite
   - Update `.github/workflows/green-core-validation.yml` with new test patterns
   - Ensure new tests are included in the CI pipeline
   - Verify tests pass in the GCV environment

4. **❌ FAILED TESTS MANAGEMENT**
   - Tests that fail due to missing future implementations should be documented
   - Add failed tests to a "Failed Tests List" for later re-testing
   - Include clear reasoning why tests cannot be fixed at current stage
   - Mark tests for future implementation when dependencies are available

### 📝 TASK EXECUTION CHECKLIST

For every task, ensure:

- [x] User consultation completed before starting
- [x] AWS Console integration utilized where applicable
- [x] All passing tests added to GCV suite
- [x] Failed tests documented with future implementation notes
- [x] Task completion verified with no blocking errors

### 🔄 CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

- Maintain GCV test suite as the single source of truth for system health
- Ensure all new functionality is covered by automated tests
- Keep failed test documentation updated for future reference
- Verify AWS integrations through console validation

**These guidelines apply to ALL future tasks and must be followed consistently.**
