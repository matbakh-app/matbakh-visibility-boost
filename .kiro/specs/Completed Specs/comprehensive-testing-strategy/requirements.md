# Comprehensive Testing Strategy - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive, production-ready testing strategy that ensures system stability while maintaining development velocity. The strategy implements a "Green Core" approach where critical tests must always pass, while providing clear segmentation for different test types and risk levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Green Core Test Definition

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a clearly defined set of critical tests that must always pass, so that we can maintain system stability and prevent production issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system defines Green Core tests THEN they SHALL include only production-critical functionality
2. WHEN Green Core tests fail THEN the system SHALL block all merge operations
3. WHEN Green Core tests pass THEN the system SHALL allow deployment to proceed
4. WHEN defining Green Core tests THEN they SHALL execute in under 5 minutes total
5. WHEN Green Core tests are modified THEN they SHALL require explicit approval from technical leadership

### Requirement 2: Test Segmentation and Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want different types of tests to run independently, so that infrastructure issues don't block application development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Jest tests THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with Deno or Playwright tests
2. WHEN running infrastructure tests THEN they SHALL execute separately from application tests
3. WHEN a test type fails THEN it SHALL NOT affect other test types' execution
4. WHEN tests are flaky or unstable THEN they SHALL be quarantined with clear labeling
5. WHEN test segmentation is implemented THEN each segment SHALL have dedicated CI jobs

### Requirement 3: Stable Contract Testing

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want tests to focus on stable contracts rather than volatile internals, so that refactoring doesn't break the test suite unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing public APIs THEN tests SHALL focus on input/output contracts
2. WHEN testing domain logic THEN tests SHALL validate business rules and outcomes
3. WHEN testing volatile code THEN tests SHALL use light smoke tests rather than deep assertions
4. WHEN legacy code exists THEN characterization tests SHALL document current behavior
5. WHEN contracts change THEN tests SHALL be updated to reflect new stable interfaces

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Test Execution

**User Story:** As a CI/CD system, I want to execute only relevant tests based on code changes, so that feedback is fast and resource usage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are detected THEN the system SHALL identify affected test suites
2. WHEN running targeted tests THEN execution time SHALL be reduced by at least 50%
3. WHEN test selection occurs THEN it SHALL include dependency-based impact analysis
4. WHEN full test suite is needed THEN it SHALL run on schedule or manual trigger
5. WHEN test results are available THEN they SHALL provide clear pass/fail status with detailed logs

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want clear error classification and recovery procedures, so that test failures can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL classify failures as expected vs unexpected
2. WHEN PII redaction tests run THEN they SHALL validate proper masking without false positives
3. WHEN Jest worker exceptions occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
4. WHEN React act() warnings appear THEN they SHALL be properly handled with async wrappers
5. WHEN architecture checks fail THEN they SHALL use AST parsing rather than regex for reliability

### Requirement 6: Continuous Quality Monitoring

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want continuous monitoring of test quality and system health, so that we can proactively address issues before they impact production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are quarantined THEN they SHALL have tickets with clear resolution timelines
2. WHEN test flakiness is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically flag and isolate affected tests
3. WHEN system purity degrades THEN alerts SHALL be sent to the development team
4. WHEN performance regressions occur THEN they SHALL be detected and reported automatically
5. WHEN test coverage drops THEN the system SHALL prevent merges below threshold

### Requirement 7: Production-Ready CI/CD Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a CI/CD pipeline that balances speed with thoroughness, so that we can deploy confidently while maintaining development velocity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN only Green Core tests SHALL be required for merge
2. WHEN merges to main occur THEN comprehensive test suites SHALL run automatically
3. WHEN nightly builds execute THEN they SHALL include all test types including infrastructure
4. WHEN deployments are triggered THEN they SHALL require Green Core validation
5. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN they SHALL be executable within 5 minutes

### Requirement 8: Clear Test Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a new team member, I want clear documentation about test strategy and maintenance procedures, so that I can contribute effectively to test quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN test strategy documentation SHALL be available and current
2. WHEN tests are added or modified THEN they SHALL include clear purpose and maintenance notes
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN diagnostic procedures SHALL be documented and accessible
4. WHEN test infrastructure changes THEN migration guides SHALL be provided
5. WHEN test metrics are reviewed THEN they SHALL include actionable insights for improvement

## Success Criteria

- **Green Core Stability:** 99.9% pass rate for critical tests
- **Development Velocity:** Test feedback within 5 minutes for core changes
- **System Reliability:** Zero production incidents caused by test gaps
- **Team Productivity:** Reduced time spent on test maintenance by 40%
- **Quality Metrics:** Maintained or improved code coverage with stable test suite

## Risk Mitigation

- **Test Flakiness:** Automatic quarantine system with resolution tracking
- **Infrastructure Dependencies:** Clear separation between app and infra tests
- **Performance Degradation:** Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Comprehensive documentation and training materials
- **Technical Debt:** Regular test review cycles with improvement planning
