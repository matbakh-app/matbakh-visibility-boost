# Requirements Document - Decoy Effect Pricing System

## Introduction

The Decoy Effect Pricing System implements behavioral economics principles to optimize conversion rates through strategic pricing tiers. The system uses the decoy effect (asymmetric dominance) to guide users toward premium offerings while maintaining ethical transparency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Decoy Effect Implementation

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner evaluating pricing options, I want to see clearly differentiated tiers so that I can make an informed decision about the best value option.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views pricing options THEN the system SHALL display exactly 3 tiers (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
2. WHEN pricing tiers are displayed THEN the system SHALL include one strategically positioned decoy option
3. WHEN the decoy option is presented THEN it SHALL make the premium option appear more attractive by comparison
4. IF a user selects any tier THEN the system SHALL track the selection for conversion analysis

### Requirement 2: Persona-Adaptive Pricing Display

**User Story:** As a user with a specific persona (Skeptiker, Zeitknappe, Überforderte, Profi), I want to see pricing information presented in a way that matches my decision-making style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Skeptiker persona views pricing THEN the system SHALL emphasize data, ROI calculations, and competitive comparisons
2. WHEN a Zeitknappe persona views pricing THEN the system SHALL highlight time savings and efficiency benefits
3. WHEN an Überforderte persona views pricing THEN the system SHALL provide simple explanations and guided recommendations
4. WHEN a Profi persona views pricing THEN the system SHALL show detailed features, scalability options, and enterprise benefits

### Requirement 3: A/B Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to test different pricing configurations so that I can optimize conversion rates based on data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays pricing THEN it SHALL randomly assign users to A/B test variants
2. WHEN a user interacts with pricing options THEN the system SHALL log all interactions with variant information
3. WHEN sufficient data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide statistical significance analysis
4. IF an A/B test reaches statistical significance THEN the system SHALL recommend the winning variant

### Requirement 4: Conversion Tracking and Analytics

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to track pricing conversion metrics so that I can measure the effectiveness of the decoy effect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views pricing THEN the system SHALL track the impression event
2. WHEN a user selects a pricing tier THEN the system SHALL track the conversion event with tier details
3. WHEN analytics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide conversion rates by tier and persona
4. WHEN reporting is generated THEN the system SHALL include decoy effect performance metrics

### Requirement 5: Ethical Transparency

**User Story:** As a user making a purchasing decision, I want transparent pricing information so that I can trust the value proposition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pricing is displayed THEN all features and limitations SHALL be clearly stated
2. WHEN promotional pricing is shown THEN regular pricing SHALL also be visible
3. WHEN the system uses behavioral techniques THEN it SHALL not employ dark patterns or deceptive practices
4. IF a user requests pricing details THEN complete feature comparisons SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Revenue Impact Projections

**User Story:** As a restaurant owner, I want to understand the potential revenue impact of each pricing tier so that I can make an informed business decision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pricing tiers are displayed THEN each SHALL include revenue projection estimates
2. WHEN revenue projections are shown THEN they SHALL include "unverbindlich" (non-binding) disclaimers
3. WHEN calculations are presented THEN they SHALL be based on industry benchmarks and user data
4. IF projections are clicked THEN detailed calculation methodology SHALL be available

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the pricing system to integrate seamlessly with existing persona detection and analytics infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses pricing THEN the system SHALL use existing persona detection results
2. WHEN pricing events occur THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing analytics pipeline
3. WHEN user data is needed THEN the system SHALL use existing AWS RDS connections
4. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use existing AWS Cognito integration

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user accessing pricing information, I want fast loading times so that I can quickly evaluate options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pricing data is requested THEN it SHALL load within 500ms
2. WHEN multiple users access pricing simultaneously THEN performance SHALL not degrade
3. WHEN pricing configurations change THEN updates SHALL propagate within 1 minute
4. IF the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL maintain sub-second response times

### Requirement 9: Localization Support

**User Story:** As a German-speaking restaurant owner, I want pricing information in my language so that I can understand all details clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects German locale THEN all pricing text SHALL be in German
2. WHEN currency is displayed THEN it SHALL use Euro (€) formatting
3. WHEN revenue projections are shown THEN they SHALL use German business terminology
4. IF English is selected THEN complete translations SHALL be available

### Requirement 10: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to easily configure pricing tiers and decoy parameters so that I can optimize the system without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pricing needs to be updated THEN changes SHALL be possible through configuration files
2. WHEN decoy parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration
3. WHEN new pricing tiers are added THEN the system SHALL support dynamic tier management
4. IF configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL fall back to default pricing safely
