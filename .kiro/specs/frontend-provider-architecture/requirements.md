# Frontend Provider Architecture & Runtime Stability - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical runtime errors in the matbakh.app frontend caused by missing React Context providers and improper i18n initialization. The system currently experiences crashes due to `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider`, `i18n not initialized`, and related provider wrapping issues that prevent users from completing their core jobs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Provider Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized provider system so that I never have to worry about missing context providers when building components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component uses `useAuth()` THEN it SHALL always have access to a valid AuthProvider context
2. WHEN any component uses `useTranslation()` THEN it SHALL always have access to a properly initialized i18n instance  
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all required providers SHALL be initialized in the correct order
4. WHEN a new provider is needed THEN it SHALL be added to a single centralized provider configuration
5. WHEN providers fail to initialize THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages instead of crashing

### Requirement 2: Safe Hook Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want hooks that gracefully handle missing providers so that the application doesn't crash when contexts are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `useAuth()` is called without AuthProvider THEN it SHALL return a safe fallback state with clear error indication
2. WHEN `useTranslation()` is called without i18n initialization THEN it SHALL return fallback translation functions
3. WHEN language switching occurs THEN it SHALL safely handle undefined language states
4. WHEN authentication state is accessed THEN it SHALL never throw undefined property errors
5. WHEN hooks detect missing providers THEN they SHALL log helpful debugging information

### Requirement 3: i18n System Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the language system to work reliably so that I can use the application in my preferred language without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN i18n SHALL be fully initialized before any components render
2. WHEN language detection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to German as default
3. WHEN `currentLanguage.toUpperCase()` is called THEN it SHALL handle undefined values gracefully
4. WHEN switching languages THEN all UI elements SHALL update without errors
5. WHEN translation keys are missing THEN the system SHALL display the key instead of crashing

### Requirement 4: Authentication Context Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want authentication to work reliably so that I can access protected features without encountering crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN CognitoAuthProvider SHALL wrap all routes that use authentication
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL receive updates without errors
3. WHEN multiple auth providers exist THEN only one SHALL be active to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN auth operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
5. WHEN users navigate between pages THEN authentication context SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 5: Development Experience Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear debugging tools so that I can quickly identify and fix provider-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provider errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with solution hints
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN a health check component SHALL show the status of all providers
3. WHEN building the application THEN ESLint rules SHALL warn about hooks used without proper providers
4. WHEN new developers join THEN documentation SHALL clearly explain the provider architecture
5. WHEN provider issues are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific fixes

### Requirement 6: Helmet and Meta Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper page metadata so that the application displays correctly in browsers and social media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads THEN HelmetProvider SHALL be available for meta tag management
2. WHEN `<Helmet>` components are used THEN they SHALL not cause undefined dispatcher errors
3. WHEN page metadata changes THEN it SHALL update without affecting other providers
4. WHEN the application builds THEN favicon and other static assets SHALL be properly included
5. WHEN social sharing occurs THEN meta tags SHALL be correctly populated

### Requirement 7: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the frontend to be stable in production so that users can complete their visibility checks without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application deploys to production THEN all provider-related errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN users access any feature THEN they SHALL not encounter "Provider not found" errors
3. WHEN analytics tracking is enabled THEN it SHALL not interfere with core provider functionality
4. WHEN the system scales THEN provider architecture SHALL remain performant
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN provider health SHALL be trackable and alertable

### Requirement 8: Future Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an extensible provider system so that new contexts can be easily added without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new providers are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture
2. WHEN provider dependencies change THEN the system SHALL handle updates gracefully
3. WHEN third-party providers are integrated THEN they SHALL follow the same safety patterns
4. WHEN the codebase grows THEN provider management SHALL remain maintainable
5. WHEN team members contribute THEN they SHALL easily understand and extend the provider system
