# Requirements Document - Supabase/Vercel Cleanup & AWS Migration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the migration from Supabase/Vercel to AWS infrastructure. The migration addresses critical production stability issues caused by incomplete frontend migration after the backend was successfully moved to AWS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Service Layer Migration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all frontend services to use AWS infrastructure only, so that there are no failed API calls to deprecated Supabase endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any service method is called THEN the system SHALL use AWS RDS connections only
2. WHEN ProfileService operations are executed THEN they SHALL connect to AWS RDS database
3. WHEN Score History operations are performed THEN they SHALL query AWS RDS score_history table
4. WHEN Benchmark Comparison operations run THEN they SHALL use AWS RDS score_benchmarks table
5. IF any service attempts Supabase connection THEN the system SHALL reject the operation

### Requirement 2: Environment Security Cleanup

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all Supabase credentials removed from environment variables, so that there are no exposed deprecated API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN no SUPABASE_* variables SHALL be present
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL only use AWS environment variables
3. IF deprecated credentials are found THEN the system SHALL log a security warning
4. WHEN AWS services are accessed THEN they SHALL use proper AWS credentials only

### Requirement 3: Authentication System Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want authentication to work consistently through AWS Cognito only, so that I don't experience login failures or session conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts login THEN the system SHALL use AWS Cognito exclusively
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN it SHALL be managed by AWS Cognito only
3. IF Supabase auth is attempted THEN the system SHALL redirect to AWS Cognito
4. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN they SHALL use AWS Cognito tokens only

### Requirement 4: Test Infrastructure Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to use AWS mocks only, so that CI/CD pipeline reflects production architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL use AWS RDS mocks exclusively
2. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL mock AWS Cognito only
3. IF Supabase mocks are found THEN the test suite SHALL fail
4. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL validate AWS service connections

### Requirement 5: Dependency Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want no Supabase packages in the application, so that there are no unused dependencies with potential vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN package.json is analyzed THEN no @supabase/* packages SHALL be present
2. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL not include Supabase dependencies
3. IF deprecated packages are detected THEN the build SHALL fail
4. WHEN security scans run THEN they SHALL find no Supabase-related vulnerabilities

### Requirement 6: Infrastructure Cleanup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all Supabase infrastructure references removed, so that the codebase reflects the current AWS-only architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is scanned THEN no supabase/ directory references SHALL exist
2. WHEN build scripts execute THEN they SHALL not reference Supabase configurations
3. IF Vercel references are found THEN they SHALL be replaced with AWS equivalents
4. WHEN deployment occurs THEN it SHALL use AWS infrastructure exclusively

### Requirement 7: Performance Maintenance

**User Story:** As a user, I want application performance to be maintained or improved after migration, so that the user experience is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN response times SHALL be equal or better
2. WHEN AWS services are used THEN they SHALL provide equivalent functionality
3. IF performance degrades THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available
4. WHEN load testing is performed THEN AWS infrastructure SHALL handle expected traffic

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation that the migration is complete, so that I can confirm no Supabase dependencies remain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation scripts run THEN they SHALL confirm zero Supabase references
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log successful AWS connections only
3. IF any Supabase calls are attempted THEN they SHALL be logged as errors
4. WHEN health checks execute THEN they SHALL validate AWS service availability only
