# AWS Frontend Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for integrating the existing React frontend application with the newly implemented AWS infrastructure. The goal is to migrate from Supabase authentication and API endpoints to AWS Cognito and API Gateway while maintaining seamless user experience and zero downtime.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Gateway Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to update all API calls to use AWS API Gateway endpoints, so that the application can communicate with the new AWS backend infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application makes API calls THEN it SHALL use the AWS API Gateway base URL instead of Supabase endpoints
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper authentication headers for AWS services
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be properly parsed and handled according to AWS API Gateway response format
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the application SHALL implement proper retry logic and error handling
5. IF API Gateway returns 4XX or 5XX errors THEN the application SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 2: Cognito Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using AWS Cognito instead of Supabase Auth, so that I can access the application with the new authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN they SHALL see Cognito-powered authentication options
2. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN they SHALL receive JWT tokens from Cognito
3. WHEN JWT tokens are received THEN they SHALL be stored securely in the browser
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the application SHALL automatically refresh them using Cognito refresh tokens
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN all Cognito tokens SHALL be cleared from local storage
6. IF authentication fails THEN users SHALL see appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3: Environment Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to manage different environment configurations for development, staging, and production, so that the application can connect to the appropriate AWS resources in each environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN running in development THEN it SHALL connect to development AWS resources
3. WHEN running in production THEN it SHALL connect to production AWS resources
4. WHEN environment variables change THEN they SHALL be loaded without requiring code changes
5. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the application SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 4: User Profile Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile information to be synchronized between Cognito and the RDS database, so that my user data is consistent across all systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN their profile SHALL be created in both Cognito and RDS
2. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN changes SHALL be synchronized to both systems
3. WHEN profile synchronization fails THEN the user SHALL be notified and retry mechanisms SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN a user's Cognito attributes change THEN corresponding RDS records SHALL be updated
5. IF synchronization conflicts occur THEN Cognito SHALL be treated as the source of truth

### Requirement 5: Visibility Check Integration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to use the Visibility Check feature with the new AWS backend, so that I can analyze my business's online presence using the migrated infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a Visibility Check THEN it SHALL call the AWS API Gateway endpoint
2. WHEN the Visibility Check runs THEN it SHALL use AWS Bedrock for AI analysis (when enabled)
3. WHEN results are generated THEN they SHALL be stored in RDS and displayed to the user
4. WHEN the check completes THEN users SHALL receive email notifications via AWS SES
5. IF the Visibility Check fails THEN users SHALL see detailed error information and retry options

### Requirement 6: Dashboard and Analytics Integration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to view my dashboard and analytics data from the new AWS RDS database, so that I can monitor my business performance using the migrated system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access their dashboard THEN data SHALL be fetched from AWS RDS via API Gateway
2. WHEN analytics queries are executed THEN they SHALL use optimized RDS read replicas
3. WHEN dashboard data loads THEN it SHALL display within 2 seconds
4. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate polling or WebSocket connections
5. IF dashboard data is unavailable THEN users SHALL see loading states and fallback content

### Requirement 7: File Upload and Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files (images, documents) to AWS S3 instead of Supabase Storage, so that file management uses the new AWS infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users upload files THEN they SHALL be stored in AWS S3 buckets
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN they SHALL have proper access controls and encryption
3. WHEN file URLs are generated THEN they SHALL use CloudFront CDN for optimal performance
4. WHEN file uploads fail THEN users SHALL see progress indicators and error messages
5. IF file size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring for the frontend application, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged to CloudWatch or external monitoring service
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN error details SHALL be captured and reported
3. WHEN user actions fail THEN appropriate feedback SHALL be provided
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN metrics SHALL be collected and analyzed
5. IF critical errors happen THEN development team SHALL be notified immediately

### Requirement 9: Progressive Migration Support

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to support a gradual migration from Supabase to AWS, so that we can minimize risk and ensure smooth transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feature flags are enabled THEN the application SHALL route requests to AWS services
2. WHEN feature flags are disabled THEN the application SHALL fall back to Supabase services
3. WHEN migration is in progress THEN users SHALL experience no service interruption
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL quickly revert to Supabase
5. IF dual-write scenarios exist THEN data consistency SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform as well or better than before the migration, so that my user experience is not degraded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL complete within 3 seconds
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN response times SHALL be under 500ms for 95% of requests
3. WHEN large datasets are displayed THEN pagination or virtualization SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized and cached appropriately
5. IF performance degrades THEN monitoring alerts SHALL trigger and optimization SHALL be prioritized

**EXECUTION READINESS:** All requirements are defined with clear acceptance criteria and can be implemented incrementally while maintaining system stability.
