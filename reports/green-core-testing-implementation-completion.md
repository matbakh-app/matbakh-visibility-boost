### NPM Scripts Configuration
```json
{
  "test:green-core": "./scripts/run-green-core-tests-minimal.sh",
  "test:jest": "jest --maxWorkers=50%",
  "test:ci": "jest --coverage --maxWorkers=50%",
  "test:deno": "deno test test/unit",
  "test:smoke": "playwright test",
  "test:lambda": "cd infra/lambdas && npm test",
  "test:security": "npm run test:lambda -- --testNamePattern='Red Team'"
}
```

### Jest Configuration Optimized
```javascript
// Clean separation of test types
testPathIgnorePatterns: [
  '/node_modules/',
  '<rootDir>/src/archive/',     // archived components
  '<rootDir>/archive/',         // all archive directories
  '<rootDir>/test/unit/',       // Deno tests
  '<rootDir>/test/smoke/',      // Playwright tests
  '<rootDir>/infra/',           // Lambda tests
]
```
