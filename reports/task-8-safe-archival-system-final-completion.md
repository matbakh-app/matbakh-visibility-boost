```

### Two-Tier Isolation Strategy

#### Tier 1: Permanent Archive (Hard Isolated)
- **Components:** 266 safely archived components
- **Isolation:** Complete exclusion from all build tools
- **Recovery:** Available via rollback script only
- **Risk:** Zero (cannot reach production)

#### Tier 2: On-Hold Archive (Soft Isolated)  
- **Components:** 125 high-risk components
- **Isolation:** Excluded from production, available for development
- **Recovery:** Individual restoration via CLI
- **Risk:** Minimal (controlled restoration process)

## 🔒 Production Safety Features

### Build-Time Protection
- ✅ TypeScript compilation excludes archived components
- ✅ Jest testing ignores archived test files
- ✅ ESLint prevents imports from archived components
- ✅ Vite build system excludes archived files
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline verifies archive isolation

### Runtime Protection
- ✅ No archived code can reach production bundles
- ✅ Automated verification prevents archive leaks
- ✅ Emergency rollback available if needed

### Development Flexibility
- ✅ On-hold components remain accessible for restoration
- ✅ Individual component restoration capability
- ✅ Dry-run mode for safe testing
- ✅ Comprehensive dependency validation

## 📊 Archive Statistics

### Component Distribution
- **Total Analyzed:** 391 components
- **Permanently Archived:** 266 components (68%)
- **On-Hold for Review:** 125 components (32%)
- **Manual Archives Preserved:** 100+ files
- **Total Archive Size:** ~2.1MB of legacy code safely isolated

### Risk Assessment Results
- **Low Risk:** 266 components → Permanent archive
- **High Risk:** 125 components → On-hold with detailed analysis
- **Critical Dependencies:** All identified and documented
- **Active Routes:** All mapped with Kiro alternatives

## 🧪 Verification Results

### Archive Isolation Verification: ✅ PASSED
```bash
npm run archive:verify
```

**Complete Results:**
