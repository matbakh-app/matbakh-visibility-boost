## Violations (8)

### CRITICAL: Legacy API Patterns
- **File**: `src/services/legacy-supabase-client.ts` (archived)
- **Description**: Contains Supabase client initialization
- **Recommendation**: Ensure this file is properly archived and not imported

### HIGH: Auth Component References
- **File**: `src/components/auth/SupabaseAuth.tsx` (archived)
- **Description**: Legacy Supabase authentication component
- **Recommendation**: Verify all imports are updated to use Kiro auth

### HIGH: Database Connection Patterns
- **File**: Various database utilities
- **Description**: Some connection strings may reference legacy endpoints
- **Recommendation**: Audit all database connections for AWS RDS migration

### MEDIUM: Upload Handler Legacy
- **File**: `src/services/upload-legacy.ts`
- **Description**: Contains legacy upload patterns
- **Recommendation**: Migrate to S3-based upload system

### MEDIUM: Dashboard Legacy Components
- **File**: Archived dashboard components
- **Description**: Legacy dashboard components still referenced
- **Recommendation**: Update all dashboard imports to use Kiro components

### MEDIUM: VC Result Processing
- **File**: `src/components/vc/result-processor.ts`
- **Description**: Contains some legacy result processing logic
- **Recommendation**: Refactor to use pure Kiro patterns

### LOW: Test Configuration
- **File**: Test setup files
- **Description**: Minor legacy test utilities
- **Recommendation**: Clean up test utilities to use Kiro patterns

### LOW: Configuration Files
- **File**: Various config files
- **Description**: Some configuration references to legacy systems
- **Recommendation**: Update configuration to remove legacy references

## Recommendations

1. üö® **Address Critical Legacy API Patterns**: Remove or properly archive all Supabase client references
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Update Auth Component Imports**: Ensure all authentication flows use Kiro-based components
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Audit Database Connections**: Verify all database connections use AWS RDS endpoints
4. üìã **Clean Up Upload System**: Complete migration to S3-based upload system
5. üîß **Update Dashboard References**: Ensure all dashboard components use Kiro implementations
6. üß™ **Refactor VC Processing**: Clean up any remaining legacy patterns in VC result processing
7. üìù **Configuration Cleanup**: Update all configuration files to remove legacy system references
8. üîÑ **Run Full Validation**: After fixes, run comprehensive validation to verify improvements

## Certification Status

‚ùå **NOT CERTIFIED**: System does not meet purity requirements (score < 95%)

**Required for Certification:**
- API Purity: ‚ùå (75% - needs 95%+)
- Test Purity: ‚úÖ (100%)
- Component Purity: ‚ö†Ô∏è (80% average - needs 95%+)
- Configuration Purity: ‚ö†Ô∏è (needs audit)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)**:
   - Archive or remove all Supabase client references
   - Update auth component imports
   - Audit database connection strings

2. **Short Term (Next 30 Days)**:
   - Complete upload system migration
   - Clean up dashboard component references
   - Refactor VC result processing

3. **Long Term (Next 90 Days)**:
   - Implement automated purity checks in CI/CD
   - Regular purity validation reports
   - Maintain 95%+ purity score

## System Architecture Status

The system has made significant progress in the migration to Kiro-based architecture:

- ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure**: AWS-based (RDS, S3, Cognito, Bedrock)
- ‚úÖ **AI/ML Pipeline**: Fully Kiro-implemented
- ‚úÖ **Test Framework**: Clean and Kiro-compatible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legacy Cleanup**: In progress, needs completion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configuration**: Needs final cleanup pass

## Conclusion

The matbakh.app system is well on its way to achieving Kiro purity certification. With focused effort on the identified violations and recommendations, the system can achieve the required 95%+ purity score within 30 days.

The foundation is solid with core infrastructure, AI pipeline, and test frameworks already meeting Kiro standards. The remaining work focuses on cleanup and ensuring all legacy references are properly removed or archived.
