   - Proper exit codes and error handling

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Pre-validated Test Runner (Requirement 2.3)

- **Phase-based Execution**: Tests are executed in 3 phases based on confidence levels
  - Phase 1: High confidence tests (EXCELLENT status, Kiro components)
  - Phase 2: Medium confidence tests (GOOD status, interface match)
  - Phase 3: Integration tests (validated integration scenarios)

- **Safe Test Selection**: Only executes tests that have been validated by the Test Selection Engine
- **Fail-fast Mode**: Optional early termination on unexpected failures
- **Concurrency Control**: Configurable parallel test execution with batch processing

### ✅ Real-time Result Analysis (Requirement 2.3)

- **Live Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on test execution progress
- **Immediate Classification**: Failures are classified as they occur
- **Performance Monitoring**: Duration tracking for individual tests and phases
- **Success Rate Calculation**: Continuous monitoring of pass/fail ratios

### ✅ Failure Classification System (Requirement 2.4)

Intelligent classification of test failures into 5 categories:

1. **Expected Failures**: Known interface mismatches, documented issues
2. **Unexpected Failures**: New test failures, assertion mismatches
3. **Infrastructure Failures**: Timeouts, missing dependencies, environment issues
4. **Interface Mismatches**: Known API interface changes
5. **Timeout Failures**: Test execution timeouts

Each failure includes:
- Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
- Category classification
- Detailed description
- Suggested remediation action
- Known issue flag

### ✅ Safe Test Report Generation (Requirement 2.4)

Comprehensive reporting system with:

- **Detailed JSON Report**: Complete execution data with all test results
- **Markdown Summary**: Human-readable summary with recommendations
- **Executive Summary**: High-level metrics and confidence levels
- **Failure Analysis**: Categorized failure breakdown with action items
- **Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions based on results
- **Next Steps**: Actionable guidance for system cleanup progression

## Technical Architecture

## CLI Interface

### Command Options
```bash
npm run test-executor [OPTIONS]

--coverage-map <path>     # Custom coverage map path
--timeout <ms>           # Test timeout (default: 30000)
--concurrency <num>      # Max concurrent tests (default: 4)
--output-dir <path>      # Report output directory
--fail-fast             # Stop on first unexpected failure
--verbose               # Enable detailed logging
--dry-run               # Simulate execution
--help                  # Show help message
```

### Exit Codes
- **0**: Success or expected failures only
- **1**: Unexpected or infrastructure failures detected

## Integration with System Architecture Cleanup

### Workflow Integration
1. **Phase 2 Completion**: Test Selection Engine generates safe test suite
2. **Phase 2.5**: Targeted Test Executor validates safe tests
3. **Phase 3 Readiness**: System cleanup proceeds only with validated tests

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Pre-validation**: Only executes tests marked as safe
- **Failure Classification**: Distinguishes expected from unexpected failures
- **Confidence Adjustment**: Updates confidence levels based on execution results
- **Rollback Support**: Provides data for rollback decisions

3. **Historical Analysis**: Track execution trends over time
4. **Integration with CI/CD**: Direct integration with build pipelines
5. **Custom Reporters**: Pluggable reporting system

### Scalability Considerations
- **Large Test Suites**: Optimized for hundreds of tests
